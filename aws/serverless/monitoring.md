# Monitoring

## Separate successful invocations from failed ones

There is an _Duration_ metric for _AWS Lambda_. This metric will tell you how long the overall setup and invocation of your lambda was.
There is a problem though. This metric also takes into consideration invocations which resulted in an error. **Having errors included in your _duration_ metric, will skew the metric**. This is because the failed invocations (either by caught or uncaught exception) are much shorter (in terms of duration, latency).

To ensure that your metric is not laying to you, you should create at least 2 _duration-based_ metrics. One metric for successful invocations and one for the failed ones.

You could try using _EMF_ and instrumenting with `performance.now` within the handler of the function. While this might be what you want, you have to take into consideration, that this method will not capture the _init phase_ of your lambda function.
Another solution would be to write a **custom _extension_**. With this you have access to the `init` phase (can be notified of it).

## Buffer the _debug_ level logs

To reduce the Amazon CloudWatch costs (from my experience, they are usually the bulk of the costs of a typical, low to medium traffic serverless application), you should reduce the number of logs you produce.

Fewer logs mean less "noise" and lower costs. But what if we need those verbose logs because, for example, an error happened, and we need to debug the root cause fast?

One technique that I'm aware of is to **buffer the verbose logs and release the buffer only when an error happens**. I've described this technique in [this blog post](https://dev.to/aws-builders/saving-on-aws-lambda-amazon-cloudwatch-logs-costs-51od). It gained some traction, so I think the implementation is somewhat worth your time.

## Metrics math

This feature allows you to create metric out of multiple other metrics. You have _functions_ at your disposal.
You can reduce the costs by combining _AWS native_ metrics into 1 custom metric.

## Composite alarms

This alarms are based on other alarms.
For example you might have 2 alarms on your EC2 instance. One for CPU Utilization and one for Memory Utilization. With composite alarms, you can fire an SNS notification if CPU Utilization is at X and Memory Utilization is at Y.

## X-Ray shenanigans

`X-Ray` is the monitoring offering from AWS. You can trace how data flows through your application.
There is one problem though. Sometimes, `X-Ray` may seem not helpful at all, or just confusing.

Let's say you hooked up `X-Ray` to trace your APIGW <=> Lambda integration. **Even though APIGW returns status 400/500, `X-Ray` will report status 200 returned**.
This is because, **the 200 status code is originating from Lambda service. That 200 status code carries 500/400 status code response for APIGW**.

Go figure?

### Seeing the uncaught errors

There are 2 ways you can _raise_ an exception within our Lambda handler.

1. Just throw an error, like so `throw new Error("Boom")`
2. Return promise that rejects, like so `return Promise.reject("Boom")`. You can also reject with an error - `return Promise.reject(new Error("boom"))`

Both methods will show up within the _Exceptions_ tab in `X-Ray` (granted you pick the right segment).

Which one I would pick? Definitely no.1. It's less verbose, and allows you to unwind the stack pretty fast, instead of returning rejected promise up the stack.

## CSM - client side monitoring

This is so rad, it allows you to, based on the CLI or the SDK calls, tailor an IAM policy that is just enough for the operations that you were performing.

If you enable CSM for either the CLI or the SDK, an event will be send to a 31000 UDP port. This event contains metadata about the operation. Here is a great article on the subject matter: https://cloudonaut.io/record-aws-api-calls-to-improve-iam-policies/

I discovered this while looking on how could I reproduce the functionality of https://github.com/iann0036/iamlive
Well, it turns out that tool is using just that exact technique!

### Objectively better than CloudTrial

CSM is a objectively better way of knowing what exactly is going on within your AWS account than CloudTrial.
While the ergonomics of CSM are not up to pair, the level of visibility it gives you is unmatched. Personal recommendation: you probably need both tools, so use them in conjunction, not separation.
