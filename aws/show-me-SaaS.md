# Notes from "Show Me SaaS" show

## Episode 2 â€“ Inside SaaS Identity

- Knowing who you are as a user, connecting that to the tenancy model, and flowing that information through the application.
- JWT token is essential in the identity story. It allows you to inject a lot of context into the request.
  - You should **not** be putting a lot of info into the JWT token. Use `claims` for attributes, do **not** handle authorization via JWT.
  - Steer clear from adding _application_ data to the JWT.
- You might want to cache context extracted from JWT.
- Multi-region identity is complicated.
  - Active-active disaster recovery identity sounds lovely, but it is tough to get right.
  - Sometimes, your identity has to have regional awareness. Think GDPR.
- Each tenant uses a single Amazon Cognito User Pool per tenant or single, shared User Pool ("pool" model).
  - The information about Amazon Cognito User Pools are stored in the DynamoDB table for fast lookups.
- It would be best if you were not putting off thinking about multi-tenancy in terms of identity in your application.
