# Using Critical Observation on the Job

## Understanding Critical Observation at Work

- _critical observation_ is **not** _critical thinking_.

- _critical observation_ takes time. Sometimes a week or a month.

- **every role needs _critical observation_**.

- _critical observation_ is:

  - repeating what has been said during the meeting when noticing someones body language is screaming "I DO NOT UNDERSTAND"
  - asking clarifying questions
  - practicing active listening: "Let me rephrase in my own world so that I'm certain I understand" type of things

- people who observe and take in the information can act as a canary in a gold mine of sorts.
  Think about all the technical decisions you have made but regret. Could those be postponed ? Maybe you were not _observing_ "hard" enough?

- _emotional intelligence_ also plays a huge role in being a great _critical observer_.
  - Why did I behave this way?
  - What grind my gears?

## Developing Critical Observation Skills

- **be curious**!

  - what if there was more information?

- **remember people names**

  - it shows that YOU care
  - in a conversation repeat the person name

- practice **active observation**

  - ask clarifying questions, **when you have them**
  - "Can we spend a few more minutes on your last point...?"

- be prepared, have questions prepared if possible

- **STOP thinking ahead when listening!**

## Examples of Critical Observation in action

- having a deep understanding of what your users need will help you along the way

- getting exposure in many various areas and applying that knowledge to your work
