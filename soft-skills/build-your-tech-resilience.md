# Build your tech resilience

## Develop a growth mindset

_Fixed mindset_ is when you tell yourself that you were "not made for" something.
It could be anything really. Presenting in front of people, writing code in particular language – the list goes on and on.

The problem with _fixed mindset_ is that is locks us in a "cage". This "cage" feels oddly nice, this is our comfort zone.
But the comfort zone is a slow killer. It will eat your ambitions, drive, happiness alive.

> Having a fixed mindset also means that you seek validation and approval from others.

People who practice the _fixed mindset_ are all about others validation.

- "What if I fail"
- "They are going to fire me" (that's me)

You get the point.

In 99% of the cases nobody will care and no one will fire you.
By not trying, by not taking the chance you will loose out on potential learning opportunities – this is the _growth mindset_.

### Imposter syndrome

I personally believe that having a _fixed mindset_ is correlated to the _imposter syndrome_. At least a tiny bit.

We should be striving to improve. All the comparisons you make against the selected people are doing you no favours – you are literally wasting your time. It also damages you emotionally, bringing you down every minute you indulge with those thoughts.

### Strategies to change your mindset

We all should strive to live by the rules of _growth mindset_ (of course, if you want to be miserable, unhappy in the long term, you do not need to change anything).

First, being with noticing your inner dialogue. Hopefully it is not destructive, but most likely is.
You are most likely telling yourself that you "can not" do some things. Perhaps you rationalize this by saying you are not "smart" enough, or maybe confident enough? The problem here is that all the things we tell ourselves are, in a great majority, not true. By noticing this internal monologue you can catch yourself thinking in _fixed mindset_ and try to change it!

Second, embrace the learning process. **Ask for feedback, ask for help**. I have one secret for you: **people like it when you ask them something, it makes them feel important**. Use it. It is literally win-win situation.

### Note on feedback and influencing others

It turns out (shocker, I know) the way you give feedback might strengthen one _fixed mindset_.

> "Don't worry. Some people aren't tech people."
> "Oh wow, you must be natural at this"

The feedback above relates to things that seem constant. This is not the way you should be giving feedback.

The way you should be giving feedback is to ensure that you put the emphasis on the **impact** and the **effort**.

> "Wow, you did a great job! You must have worked very hard."
> "Notice how you tried this new way, and you got closer."

Much better. This kind of feedback feels warm, encouraging, even if it's negative.

## Enhance your self-efficacy

### What is it?

It's the self belief that you can actually do the things you are asked to do.

> Research indicates that self-efficacy is one of the most important influences in your ability to persist in learning and problem solving.

### Sabotaging your progress

Having low self-efficacy will sabotage your progress on the task and in life.
With low self-efficacy, you will be hesitant to take up new challenges, you will be reluctant to finish what you have started.

I really need to work on the notion of a "negative talk" and having severe doubts about my skills.
While I believe skewing towards another extremum i.e., being super confident, is not good, finding a happy medium is a sweet spot. (it is not easy though when you are working with people from Google, Amazon and other big companies)

### Self-confidence vs self-efficacy

The rule of thumb is: _self-confidence_ applies generally, _self-efficacy_ applies locally, in a certain area.

Both are needed to succeed. Of course, there needs to be an equilibrium between ones doubts and confidence, but I think it is safe to say that
**you will not be as successful as you want without self-confidence and self-efficacy**.

> Failure is a springboard for growth.

And another goodie.

> If you believe that you can become more capable, you'll keep going and recover from setbacks.

### Preparation vs stress

Have you ever were worried-sick before an exam? Or maybe you could not sleep because of that deadline?
On the other hand, have you ever slept like a baby before an exam or important presentation?

The key difference between those two things is **preparation**. If you are prepared, you know you did the work necessary to succeed.
Of course, the less organized you were, the more negative self-talk you are going to experience, the more stress you will have to endure.

## Improving self-efficacy

There road to improving your _self-efficacy_ is not a complicated one but a long one. It is all in the psyche, and changes to that area of ourselves usually take time.

You can start today by starting to be curious and stopping caring about what others think. Easier said than done right?
Real talk, I know it is hard but it is not complicated. So many problems could be solved if only we cared less and were curious and open more.

Next time you are faced with something new, stop thinking "Can I do this?" and start thinking "Oh nice, an opportunity to learn".
You will not get fired, really (most likely, who fires someone when they fail at something they have not done before?)

## Exercising emotional intelligence

Your emotional state has a significant impact on your work. When you feel down, unmotivated the code and outcomes you produce will most likely suffer.
Having the ability to recognize negative emotions and drilling into their cause will help you along the way.

How would that help you? Well, if you recognize that you are stressed or unmotivated, you can find a way to calm down faster.
Instead of being in a perpetual state of anxiety, you tell your coworkers what is going on. The way you talk to them changes. Instead of speaking through emotions, you speak ABOUT the feelings.

> Self-regulation. Self-regulation is your ability to control or redirect disruptive emotions and impulses. It's an essential skill in managing challenging situations such as deadlines and problems during code development or testing.

> [...] **the technical knowledge alone will not move the team forward**

> EQ has a significant impact on your interactions with your teammates and the overall success of the team. Even if your team is technically skilled, low EQ can damage morale.

The last quote speaks to my mind. I feel guilty about putting my coworkers' moods down because I felt anxiety or other negative emotions.
Acknowledging negative emotions and working through them has the surprising benefit of making the conversations more fruitful. Instead of blaming your colleague (or yourself) for writing this "bad" piece of code, you create a plan and attack with refactoring.

## Give and receive effective feedback

I like the box metaphor the section is conveying. The feedback you give should be like a box containing useful tools to advance the other person forward. I think that the most important thing to consider is to be concrete and have specific examples of behaviors/things you wish to touch on. Of course, this type of feedback might not be for everyone.

This section mentions the idea of a _wise feedback_. I would also call it _pragmatic_. Imagine yourself, you want to get better, what do you need to get better? Well for once you need to know what you suck at. The other part are the steps to take in order to get better. This is _wise feedback_.

Giving a great feedback does not mean sugar coating. Speak the truth but do it with empathy in mind.

### About code reviews

The worst thing you can do is to approve a PR without really putting any effort into reviewing it.
Doing the review itself is a bit better, but did you really do the review?

- do you have an understanding of the requirements the code is trying to fulfill?
- have you ran the branch locally?

Without doing these things you are guessing.

### On receiving feedback

> It's important to recognize that issues in your work aren't a reflection of your personal worth

## Grow your cognitive flexibility

Cognitive flexibility is a measurement of how good are you are adjusting to different situations.

Were you always written code THE particular way? What would happen if it were required of you to code in a different way? Would you be angry? Or maybe you would adjust just thinking and writing style?

### Thinking outside of the box

Cognitive flexibility is related to how much you can think "outside of the box". You do not have to be some kind of genius to solve problems! Sometimes all that is required is to take a step back to have a different perspective.

In CS, we face multiple problems a day. We have developed ways of solving them – pair programming, speaking to a "duck," and others.

Sometimes it's not even about the solution to the problem. If you can develop a **potential** solution, that is already a huge win. You can then filter that solution through the lens of your peers. This approach usually works wonders.

### Taking a step back

How often did you get stuck on a problem only to hammer on it away for more hours? I know I did, many times. Looking back, I should have let go of many things. Why did I not do that?

For me, it was the inability to take a **step back** and reassess the situation. A new vantage point is a precious thing to have.
