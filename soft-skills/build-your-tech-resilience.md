## Develop a growth mindset

_Fixed mindset_ is when you tell yourself that you were "not made for" something.
It could be anything really. Presenting in front of people, writing code in particular language – the list goes on and on.

The problem with _fixed mindset_ is that is locks us in a "cage". This "cage" feels oddly nice, this is our comfort zone.
But the comfort zone is a slow killer. It will eat your ambitions, drive, happiness alive.

> Having a fixed mindset also means that you seek validation and approval from others.

People who practice the _fixed mindset_ are all about others validation.

- "What if I fail"
- "They are going to fire me" (that's me)

You get the point.

In 99% of the cases nobody will care and no one will fire you.
By not trying, by not taking the chance you will loose out on potential learning opportunities – this is the _growth mindset_.

### Imposter syndrome

I personally believe that having a _fixed mindset_ is correlated to the _imposter syndrome_. At least a tiny bit.

We should be striving to improve. All the comparisons you make against the selected people are doing you no favours – you are literally wasting your time. It also damages you emotionally, bringing you down every minute you indulge with those thoughts.

### Strategies to change your mindset

We all should strive to live by the rules of _growth mindset_ (of course, if you want to be miserable, unhappy in the long term, you do not need to change anything).

First, being with noticing your inner dialogue. Hopefully it is not destructive, but most likely is.
You are most likely telling yourself that you "can not" do some things. Perhaps you rationalize this by saying you are not "smart" enough, or maybe confident enough? The problem here is that all the things we tell ourselves are, in a great majority, not true. By noticing this internal monologue you can catch yourself thinking in _fixed mindset_ and try to change it!

Second, embrace the learning process. **Ask for feedback, ask for help**. I have one secret for you: **people like it when you ask them something, it makes them feel important**. Use it. It is literally win-win situation.

### Note on feedback and influencing others

It turns out (shocker, I know) the way you give feedback might strengthen one _fixed mindset_.

> "Don't worry. Some people aren't tech people."
> "Oh wow, you must be natural at this"

The feedback above relates to things that seem constant. This is not the way you should be giving feedback.

The way you should be giving feedback is to ensure that you put the emphasis on the **impact** and the **effort**.

> "Wow, you did a great job! You must have worked very hard."
> "Notice how you tried this new way, and you got closer."

Much better. This kind of feedback feels warm, encouraging, even if it's negative.
