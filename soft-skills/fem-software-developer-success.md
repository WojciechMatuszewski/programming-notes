# FEM Software Developer Success: Soft Skills & Testing

> Going through [this workshop](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/dev-soft-skills/introduction/) and making notes

## Ramping up on the new role

- Ask questions.

  - You are supposed to be asking questions. No matter if you are new or already within the team for some time.

  - **At this stage, your goal should be to get yourself familiar with any rituals, or "tribal knowledge" that the team has**.

- Pair program!

  - This _might_ seem like a waste of time, but in reality, you will get up to speed _much faster_.

## Developer Growth Essentials

- **Time estimation** is critical.

  - You are supposed to have necessary skills to deduce when a given task will be finished.

    - **Tasks ARE NOT fixed entities**. You should be communicating delays and **proposing next steps**.

### Estimation

- Very hard. Everyone gets it wrong from time to time.

  - **Spiking** could be a viable strategy to uncover as many unknowns as possible up-front.

    - In this context, it means doing the work end-to-end as soon as possible, even if you will delete all that you have done at the end.

- **If you have multiple tasks to do, quickly check if there are any dependencies to accomplish a given task**.

  - Perhaps designs are missing. Perhaps you need to align with another team? **The more _dependencies_ the task has, the more time it will take**.

- Communicating more than you though you need is actually beneficial.

  - In the worst case, someone can ignore what you said. No harm done there.

  - In the "best" case, they will notice your update and act on it.

### Feedback Loops

- **It is up to you to look for feedback**. Nobody is obliged to give it to you.

  - It is a good practice to give timely feedback, but you should not be reliant on others.

- **Ask very specific questions**. Vague questions like "how am I doing" are not helpful.

- **ASK FOR HELP**. We all pretty much pretend we know what we are doing. There is NO SHAME in asking for help.

  - **When asking for help, tell what you already tried and what were the results**. If you do not, you might waste other people time.

### Surfacing Your Accomplishments

- Again, **it is up to you to advocate for yourself**.

  - Everyone is busy with their stuff. Do you really expect someone to keep track of notable things you have done for you?

- **Creating a "brag doc"** is a good strategy to accumulate a log of things you are proud of.

> Wojciech: I should be advocating for myself more. There is no shame in doing that.

## Opportunities and Networking

- **Building trust with others and networking** increases your chances of getting new opportunities.

  - The opportunities you might get are a **great source of learning and growth**.

- Remember, collaboration and teamwork are not zero-sum game. You can make it so everybody wins.

  - This is how you create trust.

- **Knowing what to build also plays a role in earning trust**.

  - If you think the project you are working on does not make sense, and you have **a valid reason for it**, speak up!

    - Pushing back should not be viewed as something negative. People will often respect you more when you push back.

### Guide to Building Relationships

- Talk to people face-to-face.

  - Either in real life or through Zoom or similar software.

- **It is the connection and the feeling that you understand the other person** are the main catalysts in any relationship.

  - People want to be heard and understood. That is an **universal thing**.
