# Listening

Being a good listener is an essential skill that needs to be mastered by any software engineer. Time and time again, my experiences showed me that programmers mostly work with people and write code from time to time.

Being a good at programming is no longer THE thing that you have to focus on.
If you want to be great, a craftsman, you need to master the listening skills.

I'm writing these notes based on the _Becoming a Better Listener_ course on _pluralsight_ by Jason Alba.

## Why would you care

Ok, so you do not really care. I can understand this point of view.
In fact, I used to be you. I used to not care about listening to others - as long as I understood what I'm supposed to be doing, I would be fine.

Looking back, that was a huge mistake. In fact, being a good listener will make you move valuable, much more valuable.

- You will be more efficient in your job. Think of the time you were trying to solve some programming problem only to find out it was not necessary in the first place?

- You will be more wanted by the employers. A programmer who can communicate with the product and clients? Wow.

## Improving your listening skills

- Make an eye contact, but **do not stare**
- Your _body_ is engaged
- Periodic response
- Ask clarifying questions
- Ask relevant questions
- **Be patient**

### Eye contact

Eye contact is basically the equivalent of a "Are you there?" question.
It is very important but can be overdone. Do not stare, keep in mind where you look if you do not look at the others person eyes.

### Asking clarifying questions

The power of clarifying questions is huge. Not only they help you cement the information that was just relied to you, but also they can help to clarify the idea on the _producer_ side (the person that is talking to you)

Some of the formulas

> Do you mean to say ... ?
> Are you saying that ... ?
> Are you implying ... ?

### Follow up

While working at Stedi, I noticed that some engineers will send me a _Meeting minutes_ or a followup email after the conversation.
I instantly became a fan of this idea, right after I received first such email.

In my opinion, the _follow up_ is THE way to ensure that everyone is on the same page. You would be surprised how many people do not get what you said to them but still insist that they understand the topic at hand.

The _follow up_ can be really simple (and usually is). Just a list of things you talked about and next steps if necessary.

### Listening with a purpose

One way to force yourself to listen very carefully, is to go to a meeting with a goal of explaining what was the meeting about to the other person.

This tactic will make you sum up the meeting to a colleague or any other person that might be interested. It does not have to be formal, you can just ask to take some of their time and discuss the meeting (even better if there were on the same meeting).

## Helping others to listen to you

### Creating the right environment

You are responsible for removing all possible distractions. Sometimes that means
moving the conversation to a different place, sometimes asking someone to turn the TV off.

### Be assertive not aggressive

Sometimes people want to push their agenda on us. You most definitely heard someone saying "I really think you should ...".

Of course, it's up to you to judge if the agenda the person is trying to push is a reasonable or not. If not, **politely say no, and repeat until the person gives up**. This way no relationship be harmed. You are not aggressive, just assertive.

### Relay the message clearly

- **Do not use jargon**

- If you are not sure that the person understands, show them, walk them through

- Be confident, even if you have to lie to yourself

- Ask the audience questions, if they are not asking them, help them ask the questions, guide them to the answer
