## Understanding Emotional Intelligence

### What is Emotional Intelligence

- The definition is hard to define, it's subjective.

* EQ has five basic principles or pillars if you will:

  - Self-awareness
  - Self-regulation
  - Self-motivation
  - Empathy
  - Social skills

- Someone with high EQ is someone who we like to be around, we like to work with.

* Part of your job is to ensure that you are not a jerk.

### Self-awareness

- Means being aware of one's feelings as they occur.

* Emotions should be treated differently than feelings. Feelings stem from emotions. Emotions are very temporary.

- Have an understanding how you react in different situations. With that knowledge you can control your behavior.
  You can be aware that this is how you feel and decide what to do next.

### Empathy

- Understanding emotions of another person.

* Without empathy you might have a hard time working with others.

- Be open to other people. Be aware of other people.

### Win-win situations

- Instead of thinking _win-lose_ where you manipulate others to gain advantage, think _win-win_.

* It comes down to being genuine. Like really, stop trying to win all the things, stop thinking that only YOU can get something. There is plenty
  of everything for everyone.

## Making Better Decisions in Pressure Situations

- Self regulation will help you with calming your emotions.

* Self awareness is key and ties with self regulation.

- Putting emotions and feeling into words might help you dealing with pressure.

* Plan for the though situation. Preparation will help you greatly, for example taking care of ones physical needs.

- Communicate the information with calm in mind. Do not skip details that should not be skipped, even if they are not a great news.

## Improving Relationships through better EQ

- Mentoring and high EQ goes hand in hand

* If you mentor and have high EQ? Man, you will get far

- Knowing your "why" is crucial. It does not matter if its "I'm here to pay my bills" or "I'm here to save the world".
  Intrinsic motivation is very important. Ask others about their "why".

* Whats get tracked gets improved.
