## Make yourself replaceable

Why on earth would you make yourself replaceable? Is not being unique and "the only person fit for the job" good for you?

That is what I was thinking for the longest time. It turns out that this is not exactly the case.

There is a huge benefit in being **replaceable in a given area** – it allows you to move on to bigger and more exciting things.

Imagine being in a team. Only, and only you, know how to operate a given part of the codebase. Feels nice, right? You get that warm and cozy feeling that you will not be fired any time soon because you are needed - WRONG!

Now, instead of pursuing other interesting projects within your company, you are stuck at your team (they might be a great bunch of people, that does not matter). You locked yourself in. There is no going back. You stagnate.

Instead of being a knowledge silo, spread the knowledge to people around you. Make sure they can operate the system just as well, if not better, than you.
Would that mean giving them assignments that you deem interesting at first? Yes! The payoff? You are free from the shackles of your domain. You can switch projects – guilt-free!
