# Dometrain Soft Skills for Engineers

- You will not become a _great_ software engineer by using "hard" skills alone. **To progress to the "next" level, you will have to leverage soft skills**.

  - Software development is a _team sport_. Good soft skills can help you build trust with other people.

## Written communication skills

- **Especially important in remote-first culture**.

- It will help you greatly with your day-to-day work.

  - Asking for help.

  - Presenting ideas.

  - Discussing your work with fellow engineers.

- **Start with the most important point**. Do not waste others people time!

- Avoid jargon.

- **Consider organizing your thought using bullet points**.

- Understand your audience.

  - You would use different language when communicating with your peer than a director.

## Verbal Communication

- The **tone of your voice much match the context**.

- The **pacing, or how fast you are speaking, needs to accommodate pauses**. This allows people to soak the information and ask questions if needed.

- **Always strive for clarity**. You are being smart by _making_ the thing you are talking sound difficult.

  - Smart people can explain very complex subjects to everyone. That makes them smart!

## Working within teams

- Trust. Trust is a currency. **You gain trust by being dependable and getting stuff done**.

- Collaboration. "Backseat development" won't cut it.

- Respect and have empathy for others. You are a unit. Everyone could have a bad day, **including yourself**.

- Address any alignment issues early. The earlier the better.

  - Conflicts are bound to happen â€“ you are working with _other people_ after all. What matters is that you all can compromise and work together.

## Cross Functional Collaboration

- You need a shared goal. **That shared goal has to be agreed upon by everyone**. If there is no shared goal, the work will progress much slower.

  - If the goal is not well defined, people might have trouble understanding how _their_ work fits the bigger picture. In such cases, usually, people are not as motivated to _do the work_.

- **The clear, jargon-free communication is paramount**. It is the backbone of alignment and understanding.

## Handling Stress and Burnout

- **Life is a marathon, not a sprint**.

  - Yes, life will apply a lot of pressure on you, but **whatever happens, make sure to unwind, to rest, and take care of yourself**.

  - The longer you stay under prolonged period of stress, the more your performance diminish.

- **Learn to say no**. Consider how much you gain by this.

  - Yes, you might miss on some opportunity (is that _really_ the case?), but what you gain in priceless - time.

## Prioritization

- In most cases, it is **much better to communicate the prioritizing challenge you face than to make a decision yourself**.

  - The main benefit here is that **some people MIGHT be able to help you and take care of the _other_ thing that created the challenge in the first place**.

- Be aware of _unbounded_ work, like research or experimentation.

  - **The solution here is to _time-box_ that effort**.

    - This allows you to reflect what we have achieved given the alloted time, and answer a _very_ important question: "Do we want to invest more time into this direction or not?".

- Understand what is _urgent_ and what is _important_.

  - Bugs are a good example: how _critical_ the bug is? You might be tempted to _fix all_ bugs, but in reality, you need to accept the fact that not all things are perfect and move on to more important things (which often involves new features).
