## Introduction to AI-Assisted Software Development

This lesson was a very brief and quite shallow introduction to the course contents. Nothing major to note.

## Context Engineering & Frictionless Setup

- TIL about `jina.ai` and how easily you can transform any page into markdown.

- Symlinks are making a comeback! Since we have so many configuration tools like `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.mcp.json`, or `.cursor/mcp.json`, using symlinks to ensure they have the same contents is quite nice.

  - You can also use a tool like [`ruler`](https://github.com/intellectronica/ruler) for this.

- Asking the agent to plan features is great, but **you can also ask the agent to plan for refactoring work**.

  - Force it to provide you with a cost/benefit analysis. While I do not personally trust it, it will most likely make the output better.
