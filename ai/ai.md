# About AI

## Basics

- Todays AI models are based on _neural network algorithms_.

  - The simplest algorithm you could use is called _linear regression_. This is where you try to guess a value based on another value.

    - You can think about _linear regression_ as plotting the dataset on x,y axis, then trying to fit a line, so that the line "touches" the most amount of points. Then, you look at the line and guess the next number based on that.

## RAG

- **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration means **adding additional set of data into the LLM "knowledge base"**. [Here is a great video about this topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D1OfcDW1M).

  - A good example would be asking the LLM about the planet with the highest amount of moons. **The data LLM has could be outdated** as such it might give you wrong answer. Now, if you **augment** the data LLM has with sources from, let us say NASA, the LLM would be able to give a correct answer.

    - **The LLM would first ask the "content store" for the answer**. If the answer is there, the LLM would use that as a data source. Otherwise it uses the knowledge it already has.

- In the context of AI, the **word embeddings** are representation of words as array of numbers called **vectors**.

  - You might think of embeddings as "classifications". The modal will classify some word to a given number.

  - The numbers in the vector represent how similar each word is to another word. For example, the vector for _"I took my cat for a walk_" would be similar in terms of numbers to the _"I took my dog for a walk"_.

  - The **embeddings are then feed into some kind of _similarity search_ engine** which LLM use to retrieve the final answer.
