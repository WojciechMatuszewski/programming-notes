# FEM Enterprise Design Systems Thinking

From [this workshop](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/enterprise-design-systems/).

## Introduction

- You might not need the design system. It all depends.

  - How many products do you have?

  - How many people does your organization hire?

  - How stable is the market? Can you afford the investment into the design system now?

## Anatomy of a Design System

- Foundations, Tokens, Core Systems, Components

- Tokens are "codified" foundations. Think variables, like variables for very specific brand-related colors.

- Core Systems are set of building blocks that enable you to solve common UI challenges.

- Components are the reusable pieces to build digital interface.

  - Core Systems and anything below that provide flexibility.

## Maturity Model Overview

- Stage 1: The v1. here we should focus to discover what is important to our brand

- Stage 2: Growing Adoption. Make it easy to adopt.

- Stage 3: Surviving the Teenage Years. Build a product team and mindset.

- Stage 4: Evolving a Healthy Program. Mature into stable leadership via the design system.

## Origin Stories

- Top Down.

  - The leadership was involved in bootstrapping the project.

  - You have a formal budget and a high pressure to deliver.

- Grassroots.

  - The leadership is not involved.

  - Informal budget.

  - No pressure to deliver. Narrow scope.

- Most design systems start with some characteristics from both origin stories.

## Framework for How To Mature

- Education, Engagement, Evolving

- It is essential to understand what to build. **The worst thing you can do is to build the wrong thing**.

## Framework for Maintaining Stability

- Relates to authority (leadership support), tradition (people get used to using it) and value (offers a real value).

## Design System Culture

- Communicate that creating the design system takes time. Sometimes it takes a LOT of time.
