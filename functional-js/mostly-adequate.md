# Mostly Adequate Javascript

This is me taking notes from the book. Many chapters will be skipped and notes
will probably be chaotic.

## Chapter 07: Hindley-Milner and Me

So functional paradigm has types. These are used for, well, knowing that's the
shape of a given function. If you know `typescript` or `flow` you should be good
here.

```js
// capitalize :: String -> String
const capitalize = (s) => toUpperCase(head(s)) + toLowerCase(tail(s));

capitalize("smurf"); // 'Smurf'
```

Pretty easy stuff right? `name :: TYPES`

We can also do a _generic_ variation of this. Just like in typescript, but the
syntax is a little bit different (it's more like a convention)

```js
// identity :: a -> a
const identity = (x) => x;
```

So here, `a` can be any type.

You can also _group_ types. This is nothing special, just helps with
readability.

```js
// match :: Regex -> (String -> [String])
const match = curry((reg, s) => s.match(reg));
```

So the act of matching in this part is the `(...)` syntax.

Taking a function as a parameter is interesting when it comes to HM types.

```js
// map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
const map = curry((f, array) => array.map(f));
```

Here, `map` takes a function which _maps type `a`_ to _type `b`_. And since map
always return arrays we project that in the type itself.

Typing reduce is fun, check it out:

```js
// reduce :: ((b -> a) -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
const reduce = curry((reducer, acc, array) => array.reduce(reducer, acc));
```

This may seem cryptic at first but it's not that hard tbh.

- `((b -> a) -> b)` this is our reducer function, `b` is the accumulator and `a`
  is the next item

* `b -> [a] -> b` `b`, again is our accumulator (look at the curry signature),
  `[a]` is the array and `b` notes that we return the shape of accumulator. `b`
  is a generic type as in it could be an array or an object or anything really.

### Constrains

Just like in any type-language instead of using generics or built-in types you
can constrain parameters to a given shape (like `interface`)

```js
// sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
```

Syntax is a little bit different. We are using `=>` first then normal `->`.

## Chapter 08: Tupperware

So a container. This will help us:

- manage error handling
- async actions
- state
- effects

All of these are not really possible with pure tiny composable functions.

Lets create a container

```js
class Container {
  constructor(x) {
    this.$value = x;
  }
  static of(x) {
    return new Container(x);
  }
}
Container.of(3);
// Container(3)

Container.of("hotdogs");
// Container("hotdogs")

Container.of(Container.of({ name: "yoda" }));
// Container(Container({ name: 'yoda' }))
```

So far so good. This is like a structure that holds our data. One thing that is
very important: **once data goes into the container IT STAYS THERE**, this
concept is usually hard for people to grasp.

### Functor

So a functor is, MAINLY, structure that you can map over (has `map` method).
Since our container holds value, we can make it a _Functor_

```js
// map :: (a -> b) -> Container a -> Container b
Container.prototype.map = function (f) {
  return Container.of(f(this.$value));
};
```

With types, we are constraining the result to `Container` type.

### Maybe

This concept shows the power of the notion of a container. Basically
_container-mentality_ allows us to implement other structures that are somewhat
complex.

```js
class Maybe {
  static of(x) {
    return new Maybe(x);
  }

  get isNothing() {
    return this.$value === null || this.$value === undefined;
  }

  constructor(x) {
    this.$value = x;
  }

  map(fn) {
    return this.isNothing ? this : Maybe.of(fn(this.$value));
  }

  inspect() {
    return this.isNothing ? "Nothing" : `Just(${inspect(this.$value)})`;
  }
}
```

`Maybe` is pretty similar to our previous container. It has added benefit of
checking if the value is _falsy_ and handling that case.

```js
Maybe.of({ age: 10 }).map(prop("someRandomProp")).map(addTen); // Nothing
```

No errors, it just returns `Nothing` in this case since we have null checking
built-in to our container :).

### Pure Error Handling with Either

`Either` might be very similar to `Maybe`. It has two subtypes `Left` and
`Right`.

These are used to express the notion of _failure_ and _success_. There is one
key difference with Maybe though (except having different sub-types). `Either`
**captures the reason of failure** (with `Maybe` we do not have that
information).

```js
Either.of("rain").map((str) => `b${str}`); // Right(str)
Either.of(123).map((num) => num.toLowerCase); // Left(e)
```

To get the values we usually use `fold` operator. This operator allows us to
supply arguments for `Left` callback and `Right` callback.

```js
Either.of("rain")
  .map((str) => str)
  .fold(
    (e) => console.log(e),
    (val) => console.log(val),
  );
// rain
```

### IO

`IO` is used for handling the _side effects_ of our application. It's like
creating a grenade from all the impure stuff and then pulling the pin.

**These side effects has to be SYNC!!**

```js
const windowIO = IO.of(() => window);

windowIO.map((window) => window.innerWidth);

// HOW GOOD IS THAT!
windowIO
  .map(prop("location"))
  .map(prop("href"))
  // it can also be called run or smth
  .value();
```

You should not think about inner `IO` value as a function. That is
implementation detail and we all know how good, for example, testing
implementation details is right ? Kent wink ;).

`IO` allows you to take full advantage of composition and still deal with _side
effects_ whose you sometimes cannot avoid.

### Async tasks

Again we are building on something we already know. `Taks` is quite similar to
`IO` but it deals with asynchronicity.

`Task` also carries the notion of success and failure but instead of `folding`
we use `fork`.

```js
const blog = ...
blog({}).fork(
  error => $('#error').html(error.message),
  page => $('#main').html(page)
);
```

`Task` and `IO` and `Either` can be used together. Its all up to the developer
and the challenge he faces.
