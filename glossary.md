# Glossary

Terms, words I was not familiar with at first.

- **Load shedding**: act of dropping work to preserve the system availability.
  It's much better, in the scenario of overload, to prioritize some of the requests and process those and drop others than to try
  to fullfil every request. [More on this topic here](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/using-load-shedding-to-avoid-overload/)

- **Heuristics**: in software, it refers to the "way of doing things". Usually, derived from experience and learning based techniques.
