# DevOps for Developers

## Introduction

- DevOps is interesting because you get to work across the whole stack. This includes multiple languages and technologies.

## What Exists Today

- DevOps is poorly defined.

- The are cultural challenges to adopting DevOps.

  - This causes communication issues. Arguably the most common issue in the software development.

- And there is the issue of tech debt.

## What DevOps IS

- Fostering culture amongst teams and automation.

  - Note that the automation comes AFTER. Culture is the most important.

- It is **working with other people**.

  - Making sure you have the buy-in.

  - Creating trust.

- **Helping other people by making their work easier**.

  - This compounds over time!

### What DevOps IS NOT

- DevOps is **not a title or a technology tool**.

## Three W's of Strategy

1. **Why**: reasons and motivation.
2. **What**: goals and objectives.
3. **Who**: people who would benefit from it.

This framework could help you **avoid unnecessary work**. By slowing down and asking yourself a couple of questions, you can refine your understanding of the problem.

## Standards vs. Rules

- Some people react strongly in regard to rules. **Focus on standards**.

  - People **tend to agree on standards for the greater good of product**.

- Rules **seem more concrete, unbendable**. This is not a good thing.

  - You want people to voice their feedback. Maybe some team struggles with some "rule" but they are afraid to tell you that (or they think that they cannot).

- One of **the most important standards is the QUALITY STANDARD**. Your organization has to have this defined.

  - Interestingly it is often defined implicitly through teams.

- It is often worth thinking about communication standards. For example how teams handle big features (design documents and similar).

## The Power of TDDs

- Not related to the tests. It is **about the technical documents**.

  - It all **boils down to describing the problem!!**

  - Keep in mind **who are you writing it for**.

### Your First TDD

1. What problem are you trying to solve? (**this is the foundation of your document**).

2. What is the current process?

- A good example is the problem where issues stay in Slack instead of on less ephemeral channels of communication.

  - This is a culture problem.

3. What are the requirements?

   - Keep them honest. Do not add anything that you "wish" you could do.

   - Some requirements **appear to be "free" or low-cost, but in reality they are not**.

     - These mostly come in the form of vendors offering you free stuff. The stuff is not free! Your teams will have to learn the tool which takes time.

4. How do we solve this problem?

- Lean on your gut. You might be wrong, but a wrong proposed solution is better than no solution at all.

  - It keeps the people talking.

- Do your **best to keep the specific technology out of first three points**.

- In the end, writing the TDD is **asking lots of questions and answering them, even if the answer is obvious**.

  - The point is not the answer the question, **the point is to reflect on the state of things**.

        -   Such reflections also lead to solutions or help to surface underlying problem that might have been overlooked in the first place.

#### Insights from the TDD document session with the instructor

- **Sharing is carrying**.

  - It is much better to over-communicate than to under-communicate.

- If your **organization does not have the time for testing and documentation GET THE HELL OUT or CHANGE THE STATE OF THINGS**.

  - The first option is easier, the latter is much more preferred.

- Companies often do not realize that their most valuable assets, like insider knowledge is hold captive by people (either willingly or unwillingly).

  - Negligence in regards to the documentation is a huge issue.

- **Keep the solutions concrete**.

  - You can start vague, but then propose a concrete solution.

## Identifying problems

- Usually people have strong opinions on things that should be an upfront decision. If you do not take action, you run at risk of bike-shedding on things that should have been decided upon upfront.

- Standardization is a very easy way to improve agility of organization.
