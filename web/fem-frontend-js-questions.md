# Front-End & JavaScript Questions

> [From this course](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/frontend-js-questions/).

## Question 1

- **By default, the scripts are blocking the rendering and parsing of the HTML, even when they are downloading**.

  - That is why in the past some snippets told you to put the `<script>` tag at the very end of the HTML.

- The **async attribute** causes the script to **not block the parsing while it is downloaded**.

  - The parsing is blocked when the script executes.

- The **defer attribute** causes the script to **be executed when the whole HTML is parsed, it also does not block when the script is downloading**.

- When you provide both `async` and `defer`, the browser will have to pick one. Most likely it will be `async`.

  - I was unsure how the script with both `async` and `defer` works. Now I know that it will behave as if it was `async`.

## Question 2

- TIL that there is something called **CCSOM Tree** which is **basically a DOM Tree but for CSS**.

- The **combination of DOM & CSSOM Trees (with only visible elements) creates a _Render Tree_**.

## Question 3

This question is all about the DNS, and I know almost nothing about these things.

- **First**, the browser **sends the request to the DNS resolver for the IP address**.

- Then the **DNS resolver does a recursive search** to get the **_Authoritative Name Server IP_**.

  - This _Authoritative Name Server_ has the IP entry for the website.

- Keep in mind that this **dance of DNS resolving is cached, all depending on the TTL settings**.

## Question 4

A classic question of "what gets logged". This one requires the knowledge of the event loop, which behaves differently in different browser engines.

- Keep in mind that **`Promise.resolve()` is synchronous**. It will instantly invoke the `then` function.

- The **function you pass to the `Promise` constructor is also synchronous**.

- The `new Promise(() => console.log("foo"))` will log the `foo` instantly, no delay.

- **As long as you remember that the _micro-tasks_ are executed in-between the turns of the event loop, you should be good**.

  - This means that the _timers_ are executed AFTER the micro-tasks (mainly Promises).

## Question 5

- The **`dns-prefetch` performs domain name resolution in the background**.

- The **`preconnect` takes the `dns-prefetch` a bit further as it also does the TCP/TLS handshake**.

  - Make sure you are **not abusing these attributes**. It takes bandwidth to do these things and, if congestion occurs, **some critical resources might need to wait before they get the chance to perform these actions**.

- The **`prefetch` is to tell the browser to download the resource for later**.

  - The **browser might ignore your request**. If the network bandwidth is not there the _hint_ might be ignored.

- The **`preload` is a more aggressive version of the `prefetch`**. This is where you tell the browser it _must_ download a given resource.

## Question 6

This one showcases the issue with the _spread operator_ â€“ the fact that it is a shallow copy and will preserve the references of nested values. Brings the old memories of writing reducers in Angular where a library like [_immer_](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) did not exist.

## Question 7

This one is about the order of the [_navigation performance-related events_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Navigation_timing). This is usually something you get from the API docs.

It is quite fascinating how many ways there are to measure performance of the website. I was unaware this API exists.

- It seems to me like the `loadEventEnd` is a good event to perform some work when you **want to ensure that all the resources are loaded**.
