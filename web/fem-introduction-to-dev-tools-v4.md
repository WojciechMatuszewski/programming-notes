# Frontend Masters Introduction to DevTools V4

- The _Computed_ tab in the elements panel is quite useful.

  - You can search for a given CSS property and it will show you _resolved_ value. You do not have to filter through applied classes and such to get to the "real" value.

- **Consider debugging without any active extensions**.

  - In some cases, extensions mess up with the DOM or performance of the website.

- The `$0` in the console references the latest queried element in the console.

  - Pretty neat! Especially when using the "element selector" tool.

- The "scroll into view" option for a given element is quite handy if you work on large lists.

- **When debugging network-related stuff, be mindful of cache**.

  - It is very likely you have cache disabled via the "Disable cache" checkbox in the _Network_ panel.
