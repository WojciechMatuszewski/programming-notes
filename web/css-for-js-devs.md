# CSS for JS devs

## Fundamentals

- I was not sure about the difference between _pseudo-elements_ and _pseudo-classes_. The difference is that _pseudo-elements_ target "sub-elements" within a given element. On the flipside, the _pseudo-classes_ target the elements' specific state.
  The syntax is also a bit different. For the _pseudo-elements_ we use `::`, for the _pseudo-classes_ we use `:`

- The difference between `rem` and `em` values. Here is the difference:
  - The `rem` value is **relative to HTML tag font size**.
  - The `em` value is **relative to the current tag font size**.
