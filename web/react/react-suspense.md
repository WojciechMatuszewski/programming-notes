# React Suspense

## How Suspense worked in React 16

In React 16, the Suspense supported a single-use case â€“ code splitting via the `React.lazy` API, and it **did not work on the server**.

The Suspense API controlled the visibility of the content **via `display:none` CSS property**. This behavior caused some people a lot of issues, especially in cases where parent components of the suspending child are listening to the "mount" event. For more information regarding this behavior, refer to [this link](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md#behavior-change-committed-trees-are-always-consistent).

Since this version of React guaranteed that if a component started rendering, it would finish rendering no matter what, the Suspense API was limited in scope. It does not perform _placeholder throttling_(a feature where the Suspense wrapper will not render the placeholder immediately) or streaming.

As per [this post](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/7) React team referred to this version of Suspense as _"legacy Suspense"_. Interesting.

## How Suspense works in React 18

React 18 improved the capabilities of the Suspense feature.

The most notable change is that **the Suspense works on the server!**. This change is thanks to the new server-side renderer that is asynchronous and **capable of streaming data to the browser** (what SSR streaming in React context refers to).

Next, we have **new features** like **_placeholder throttling_ and transitions**. The new semantics of "I can interrupt any render and do other work" makes all these features possible.

I'm most excited about **data fetching with Suspense** and **_placeholder throttling_**. All of these and more are the subject of further discussions below.
