# React patterns

## Limiting the number of children

There are two ways one might limit the number of children the component is passed in. **Please note that I'm not talking about the children structure, only the number of them**.

**First** way of doing it is to **use the `React.Children.only`** API.
The `React.Children.only` API will ensure that the `children` prop contains a **single _React element_**.

```js
const Component = ({ children }) => {
  return React.Children.only(children);
};

const UsageOK = () => {
  return (
    <Component>
      <p>I'm a single child</p>
    </Component>
  );
};

const UsageError = () => {
  return (
    // The `Component` will throw an error.
    // Only single child is allowed to be passed.
    // React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child.
    <Component>
      <p>I'm the first child</p>
      <p>I'm the second child</p>
    </Component>
  );
};
```

The **second** way of doing it is a bit more flexible. Here, I'm referring to the **`React.Children.count`** API.
This API is more flexible because it **returns the number of _React Elements_ that were passed as `children` prop**.

Here is how I would create a component that restricted it's `children` prop to three _React Elements_.

```js
const Component = ({ children }) => {
  const childrenCount = React.Children.count(children);
  if (childrenCount > 3) {
    throw new Error("only three or less children allowed");
  }

  return children;
};
```

## lazy ref pattern

Sometimes you want to initialize the `useRef` value lazily. Now, with `useState` you can do that using the callback initializer, but `useRef` does not have that kind of API.

This is where the notion of _lazy ref_ comes in. This **will feel weird** but believe me, it's sometimes really useful.

```tsx
function Component() {
  const rootRef = React.useRef(null);
  if (!rootRef) {
    rootRef.current = SOME_VALUE;
  }

  // now I have mutable value I can use
}
```

Yes, we are doing it inside the render function, yes it looks weird, but this is a legit pattern.
For the curious, this **should be concurrent safe**. The assignment is done only once, there are no side effects.

### Usage

So check this out. You are using some kind of hook which fetches data

```jsx
const { data, error, loading } = useFetch("/users");
if (error) return <p>error</p>;
if (loading) return <p>loading...<p>

return data.names
```

The `data` will be initially `undefined` and **can be updated through the lifecycle of your component** - think _apollo cache_ or similar.

Now, there might be a time where you want to grab the **first** resolved data value. Soo how would you do it?

1. You cannot use block-level variable since the value will be re-declared between renders, so you lost your previous value.

```jsx
let firstUsers = null;

const { data, error, loading } = useFetch("/users");
if (error) return <p>error</p>;

if (loading) return <p>loading...<p>

// will not work! Any re-renders will re-create the `firstUsers`
if (!firstUsers) {
  firstUsers = data;
}


return data.names
```

2. You cannot use `useState` with initial value since we are dealing with `if` conditions

What you would do is to create a _lazy ref_

```jsx
const firstUsersRef = React.useRef(null)

const { data, error, loading } = useFetch("/users");
if (error) return <p>error</p>;

if (loading) return <p>loading...<p>

// firstUsersRef is preserved through renders. NICE!
if (!firstUsersRef.current) {
  firstUsers.current = data;
}

return data.names
```

With that, your `current` key should hold the first resolved users ðŸ¤—

## Latest Ref pattern

You will most likely use this pattern when dealing with a `debounce` function (or anything where you call the provided callback really).

The premise here is that we **do not want to re-render when the provided callback changes** but still want to use it within our logic with the certainty that we are calling the latest provided callback.

Here is the pattern

```jsx
function Component({ providedCallback }) {
  const callbackRef = React.useRef(providedCallback);

  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    callbackRef.current = providedCallback;
  });
}
```

We are using `useLayoutEffect` instead of the `useEffect` to ensure that we do the assignment before
any other code within this component runs (since `useLayoutEffect` is synchronous)

### Usage

As I mentioned earlier, you will most likely use this pattern along with the `debounce` function, so here it is

```jsx
function useDebounce({callback, delay}) {
  const callbackRef = React.useRef(callback)

  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    callbackRef.current = callback
  })

  // You SHOULD NOT! pass the `callbackRef.current` here like so: debounce(callbackRef.current)
  // The `useCallback` will close-over the `callbackRef.current` when it's initialized.
  // This means that the `callbackRef.current` would be pointing to a stale value!
  return React.useCallback(debounce(...args) => callbackRef.current(...args), delay), [delay])
}
```

## `isMounted` and functional components

While reading github issues I've noticed a that even Dan himself proposes this pattern:

```js
useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false;
    async function() {
      await somethingAsync();
      if (!cancelled) {
        setState({/*state*/})
      }
    }
    return () => cancelled = true;
  }, [])
```

But is not it the famous `isMounted` pattern? Pretty weird right?.

Either way, in such cases you should probably use **`AbortController` API**. **It is now widely supported, go and see for yourself**.

## Value/Dispatch Provider Pattern

Sometimes the thing you want to update is complex and you decide to use reducer.
Additionally you want to control the scope of changes to a given value (maybe
state) by other components.

This is where **Value/Dispatch Provider Pattern** shines.

**You can also use state, this would work the same**.

```jsx
const StateContext = React.createContext();
const DispatchContext = React.createContext();
function reducer() {
  // your reducer
}

return function Provider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <StateContext.Provider value={state}>
      <DispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        {children}
      </DispatchContext.Provider>
    </StateContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

Splitting these two makes it possible to skip `useMemo` because the values are
always the same.

### What would happen if I did not split these two

```jsx
// previous code
function Provider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  let value = { state, dispatch };
  // Creating inline object here would be the same
  // as creating a new variable like shown above.
  return <SomeContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</SomeContext.Provider>;
}
```

Now, with every render, `value` **is different** (as in Object.is notion).

Why is a big deal?

> The propagation from Provider to its descendant consumers is not subject to
> the `shouldComponentUpdate` method. Changes are determined by comparing the
> new and old values using the same algorithm as `Object.is`

Without `useMemo` every time `Provider` re-renders, all of its consumers
rerender

## Safe Function Call Pattern

Sometimes you have some side-effect you do not want to call on **unmounted**
component.

We can leverage `useRef` to make sure we are safe from memory leaks.

Let's use previous pattern to implement `safeDispatch`

```jsx
const canDispatch = React.useRef(true);
const safeDispatch = React.useCallback(
  (...args) => canDispatch.current && dispatch(...args),
  []
);

React.useEffect(() => () => (canDispatch.current = false), []);

// now you can pass safe dispatch as dispatch
```

Why would I use `useCallback` here?

From the docs we know that `dispatch` never changes (as in Object.is never
changes).

This means that if your component takes only `dispatch` as a prop you do not
need to wrap it in `React.memo` (or use `PureComponent`).

We want to replicate this behavior so we are using `useCallback` to make sure
that `safeDispatch` never changes (as in Object.is never changes).

## Context Module Functions

The name might be scary but the implementation is straightforward - really.

When you create context, especially with `useReducer` you might want to create helper functions inside the _consumer_ hook or in the _provider_ directly. This is so that you do not have to call the `dispatch` directly from within your components

```jsx
function useCounter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useContext(CounterContext);

  const increment = () => dispatch("increment");
  const decrement = () => dispatch("decrement");

  return { increment, decrement };
}
```

Pretty straightforward right? Now, **what happens when that helper function is a dependency of a hook?**
Well now you have to wrap then in `useCallback`

```jsx
function useCounter() {
  // code

  const increment = React.useCallback(() => dispatch("increment"));

  // code
}
```

While this is OK for a simple _useCounter_, having a lot of memoized functions for bigger context might be a problem. And the **solution is really simple!**

Instead of creating the helper functions inside the _consumer hook_ or _provider_, just define them at file level.

```js
function increment(dispatch) {
  dispatch("increment");
}
```

**No need for memoization!**. This also brings other benefits like _tree-shaking_ and such. Overall, it's a much cleaner solution than having this function defined inside the _consumer hook_ or the _provider_ directly.

You would use it like so:

```jsx
function Component({ prop }) {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    increment(dispatch);
    // increment is always stable!
  }, [prop]);
}
```

## Layout Components (passing props as children)

It is considered best practice to use the _composition_ characteristics of React. Instead of _prop drilling_ you should consider using the `children` (or other props) to _compose_ components together. This helps to reduce the chance of breaking something when refactoring, as there will be less changes to make, since there is less prop drilling.

Now, it is **worth remembering that it is completely okay to create specific, named props for "slotting" components**. In fact, the concepts of "slots" exist in other framework as well! **You can leverage other props than `children` for composition**.

To give you an example. Here is the `Main` component which acts as a _layout component_.

```tsx
function Main() {
  return <div>
    <Sidebar userAvatar = {<UserAvatar/>}>
    <Content
      promo={<Promo/>}
    />
    <Footer disclosure={<Disclosure/>}/>
  </div>
}
```

This example is very contrived, but it showcases the power of so called "slots". This is not an "official" concept, we are still using the regular React props. **The main point I want to drive here is that it is OKAY to use props different than `children` for composition of components**.

### The downside of this approach

The main downside of this approach is the fact that **this pattern is too flexible**. Yes you heard me right, it is too flexible. Often, with flexibility comes the danger of misuse.

Let us imagine a `Button` component taking the `icon` as a prop.

```jsx
<Button icon={<InfoIcon />}>Foo</Button>
```

What if this button is disabled? We most likely would want to change the color of the button, and the color of the icon. If that is the case, we would have to ensure that the consumer of the `Button` component changes the color somehow. There is a solution, but it is rather complex.

```jsx
function Button({ icon, disabled, children }) {
  const iconProps = disabled ? { ...icon.props, color: "gray" } : icon.props; // keep in mind that JSX are really objects.

  const ClonedIcon = React.cloneElement(icon, iconProps);
  return <button>{children}<ClonedIcon></button>
}
```

Another approach would be to pass the `icon` as a function rather than JSX. Then the `Button` could render it with the right props. Again, that is not a silver bullet as it now requires more logic in the `Button` to specify the right "default" props like size.

```jsx
<Button icon={InfoIcon}>Foo</Button>
```

**Before you use the `cloneElement` API note that the [docs say that using this API could lead to fragile code](https://react.dev/reference/react/cloneElement)**. I'm personally okay with the API, but you should also consider other alternatives like render props.

**The _render-props_ pattern allow you to achieve what you implemented with `cloneElement` without indirection**.

```jsx
function Button({ renderIcon, disabled, children }) {
  const iconProps = disabled ? {color: "gray"} : {}
  const Icon = renderIcon(iconProps);

  return <button>{children}<Icon></button>
}
```

Of course, this requires the consumer of the `Button` to actually use the object you have passed into the `renderIcon` function.

## Compound Components

### Non-flexible Compound Components

So basically you want to pass down the necessary props using `React.Children`
and `React.cloneElement` combo.

```jsx
function Counter({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return React.Children.map(children, (child) =>
    React.cloneElement(child, { count })
  );
}
```

This will make it so props are passed but **unless you have some `displayName`
convention, they are passed to every child**.

### Flexible Compound Components

#### Using `static` class methods

This can be used for styling purposes

```js
const CardHeading = styled.div``;
class Card {
  static Heading = ({ children }) => <CardHeading>{children}</CardHeading>;
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

Also using context API

```js
const CounterContext = React.createContext();
class Counter {
  state = {
    count: 0;
  }
  static Display = ({children}) => (
    <CounterContext.Consumer>
      {({count}) => <div>count{children}</div>}
     </CounterContext.Consumer>
  )
  render() {
    return (
      <CounterContext.Provider value = {{count: this.state.count}}>
        {this.props.children}
      </CounterContext.Provider>);
  }
}
```

#### Using hooks

This works basically the same as the class variant but you update classes to
functional components and use hooks. Of course you cannot use static properties.

##### The `useProvider` hook

As an addition to _flexible compound components_ pattern you will often see an `useXXX` hook defined. Usually it will look something like this

```jsx
function useProvider() {
  const context = React.useContext(ProviderContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw Error(
      "`useProvider` cannot be used outside of the `ProviderContext`"
    );
  }

  return context;
}
```

You can even make it so that the hook takes parameters and perform some calculations / derives state.

What is important here to note that **`React.useContext`** will always return the **default context value** when **there is no `Provider` up in the tree**. This is why you should **always set your `Provider` default value to null / undefined**.

## Uncontrolled Compound Components

Just like in the case of native HTML elements, like inputs, the _Compound Component_ can be _uncontrolled_. This means that you do not have to provide any refs, any state, nothing. This entry was inspired by [this blog post](https://jjenzz.com/avoid-global-state-colocate), which coins the term, but I think there is another pattern here â€“ **colocation using React portals**.

## Colocation using React portals

The colocation with React portals allows you to cover up global state with the usage of React context. It is a bit better than global state, and very useful some some UIs, **for example where one trigger causes a content in completely different part of the DOM tree to show up**.

The basic idea is to create the **context of dealing with the portal, and the context of the trigger**. Then, **one could render the content inside the portal provider**, like so:

```jsx
<SidebarProvider>
  <Sidebar /> // -> The place where you want to render the content
  <RectangleProvider>
    {" "}
    // -> Provider for the trigger
    <Rectangle /> // -> The trigger
    <SidebarPortal>
      {" "}
      // -> The portal to render it in a different place
      <RectangleStyler /> // -> The trigger "content"
    </SidebarPortal>
  </RectangleProvider>
</SidebarProvider>
```

This technique is described in depth [here](https://jjenzz.com/avoid-global-state-colocate).

## Prop Collections and Getters

This pattern was widely used with `render props` now migrated to custom hooks.

The premise is simple, supply custom props in one obj so that consumer can just
spread those without worrying about missing some props.

This can be really helpful (looking at you `react-virtualized` ðŸ˜‰)

### Prop Collections

This is you basically creating a bag with properties , which you spread on elements. These usually fulfil very common use cases

```jsx
function useInput(initialValue = undefined) {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(initialValue);
  function onChange(e) {
    setValue(e.currentTarget.value);
  }
  function resetValue() {
    setValue(initialValue);
  }
  return {
    // this is prop collection
    inputProps: { value, onChange: setValue },
    reset,
  };
}

function Component() {
  const { inputProps } = useInput();
  // now as a consumer I do not have to worry about forgetting a prop
  return <input type="text" {...inputProps} />;
}
```

Then the consumer, can just spread the `inputProps` on the component he wants to behave like a _controlled input_.

### Prop Getters

This is more flexible version on the `Prop Collections` pattern. This is where you create a _function_ instead of an object. The one benefit here is that user can specify merge their implementation with implementation of your hook.

```js
function getInputProps({ onChange: suppliedOnChange, ...rest } = {}) {
  return {
    onChange: callAll(suppliedOnChange, onChange),
    value,
    ...rest,
  };
}
```

Now instead of returning `inputProps` you will return a function. This will allow the user to do something like this

```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  // much more flexible solution!
  {...getInputProps({ onChange: () => console.log("changed") })}
/>
```

The `getInputProps` is responsible for _pseudo-composing_ the `onChange` handlers. The `tanstack/table` and `downshift` uses this pattern heavily.

## State Initializer

Sometimes your components might expose the "initialX" API (can also be named "defaultX"). Like the `input` HTML component that exposes the "defaultValue".

```tsx
<input type="text" defaultValue="foo" />
```

This is all nice, but **what would happen if the `defaultValue` changed when the `input` component is already mounted?**. Especially when your component exposes a reset function. Should we _reset_ to the "initial initial" value or the "new initial" value?

This is the question I cannot answer universally, but I would lean towards the first option â€“ always stick to the "initial initial" value.

```ts
function MyInput = ({initialValue}) {
  const {current: defaultValue} = useRef(initialValue);
  // ...

  return {reset: () => {
    setState(defaultValue)
  }}
}
```

We can **leverage the `useRef` to "ignore" any updates to the initial value**. This way, no matter what the value is, the reset function will always change the state to the "true" initial value.

Of course, if you re-mount the component, the "initialValue" will update.

## State Reducer

This is an implementation of _inversion of control_ principle. Your component / hook is using a reducer for managing it's state.
You want to expose the ability for the user to integrate with your state and influence it as the user sees fit.

```jsx
const callAll =
  (...fns) =>
  (...args) =>
    fns.forEach((fn) => fn && fn(...args));

function toggleReducer(state, { type, initialState }) {
  switch (
    type
    // code
  ) {
  }
}

function useToggle({ initialOn = false, reducer = toggleReducer } = {}) {
  const { current: initialState } = React.useRef({ on: initialOn });
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  const { on } = state;

  const toggle = () => dispatch({ type: useToggle.types.toggle });
  const reset = () => dispatch({ type: useToggle.types.reset, initialState });
  function getTogglerProps({ onClick, ...props } = {}) {
    // code
  }

  function getResetterProps({ onClick, ...props } = {}) {
    return {
      onClick: callAll(onClick, reset),
      ...props,
    };
  }

  return {
    on,
    reset,
    toggle,
    getTogglerProps,
    getResetterProps,
  };
}
// this will be very helpful
useToggle.reducer = toggleReducer;
// this is also quality of life improvement
useToggle.types = {
  toggle: "toggle",
  reset: "reset",
};

function Usage() {
  // So here we can manipulate external logic by ourselves
  function toggleStateReducer(state, action) {
    if (action.type === useToggle.types.toggle && timesClicked >= 4) {
      return { on: state.on };
    }
    return useToggle.reducer(state, action);
  }
  const { on, getTogglerProps, getResetterProps } = useToggle({
    reducer: toggleStateReducer,
  });
  // other code
}
```

Look at `toggleStateReducer` and see how easy it is for the user to fulfil his need. You do not have to implement anything internally. Pretty great!

## Control props

You are probably aware of the notion of _controlled_ and _uncontrolled_ inputs. This is where you either pass the `value` to an input (non-empty string) and `onChange` function or you do not (there is also option for `onChange` + `readOnly` prop)

Either way, **React has to know, if either you or the framework controls the state of a given element**. This **has to be true for the whole lifecycle of that element**.

When you are writing custom reusable components, you often should do the same, as in check if the consumer is passing any properties that would make your component _controlled_. This is usually done by creating `isControlled` variable.

```jsx
function MyComponent({ on, onChange }) {
  const isControlled = on != null;

  function handleChange() {
    if (isControlled) {
      const suggestedChange = .// something you would set your state to
      return onChange(suggestedChange)
    }
  // do not call setState when you are controlled! This will result in unnecessary renders.
    setState(value)
  }
}
```

This is a powerful technique, I might go as far as argue that it is much more powerful than the `state reducer` itself. But the real benefit comes from combining those 2 patterns.

### Warnings

You might have seen them, especially while working with `input` components. They usually scream at you from switching from _controlled_ to _uncontrolled_ and vice-versa.

For your custom components, you should do the same. There is a pattern which utilizes `React.Ref` which enables you to easily check if your component is transitioning from one state to another.

```js
function Component({ open }) {
  const isControlled = open != null;
  const { current: wasControlled } = React.useRef(isControlled);

  if (wasControlled && !isControlled)
    console.error("Hey, you went from controlled to uncontrolled");

  if (isControlled && !wasControlled)
    console.error("Hey, you went from uncontrolled to controlled");
}
```

Notice that I do not use the `prevState` pattern. There is no `useEffect` which saves the current state as the `prevState`. This is because the **component state (either `controlled` or `uncontrolled`) has to be the same for the entire lifecycle of that component**. There is no need to save the previous state, our point of reference should be the initial state.

## `wrapEvent` pattern

When you are building component library, you often end up building things like _accordions_ or similar. Those components often take then `onChange` prop.
It would be useful if that `onChange` prop behave just like the native one right? By that I mean that if you call `.preventDefault()`, the default behavior of the component is prevented.

You can easily do this by creating a wrapper function for that event.

```js
function wrapEvent(theirHandler, ourHandler) {
  return function (event) {
   theirHandler.?(event)
   if (!event.defaultPrevented) {
     ourHandler(event)
   }
  }
}
```

This is something what I saw when spelunking in the _reach-ui_ repo.

## Safe initial value pattern

While building components you will most likely have a prop for _initial value_. Most likely your implementation will be similar to this

```jsx
function Component({ defaultChecked }) {

  const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(defaultChecked)
  return <input type = "radio" checked = {checked}>;
}
```

and **there is nothing wrong with that**. The problem appears when you want to have a _reset_ functionality.

With the _reset_ functionality there is a possibility for the consumer to change the _initial value_ over the course of the lifetime of the component. And this **can influence the _reset_ functionality**

```jsx
function Component({ defaultChecked }) {
  const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(defaultChecked)

  // There is a possibility that the consumer changed the value of `defaultChecked` before this runs.
  const reset = () => setChecked(defaultChecked)
  return <input type = "radio" checked = {checked}>;
}
```

To combat this, use `React.useRef`. This is an _instance variable_. It will have the same value through the lifecycle, unless you yourself change it.

```jsx
function Component({ defaultChecked }) {
  const {current: initialChecked} = React.useRef(defaultChecked);
  const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(initialChecked)

  // The `initialChecked` could not have changed, it's captured by the `useRef`.
  const reset = () => setChecked(initialChecked)
  return <input type = "radio" checked = {checked}>;
}
```

Now, I have to emphasize this, **use this pattern when you are dealing with the _reset_ functionality**. Well there might be other use cases, but I think that's the most common one.

## Hooks encapsulation pattern

We all, at least once, have written code that looks similar to the following snippet.

```jsx
function Component() {
  const [stateVariable1, setStateVariable1] = useState("foo");
  const [stateVariable2, setStateVariable2] = useState("bar");

  // mixing `setStateVariable1` and `setStateVariable2` in various handlers

  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

Usually, I would have nothing against such setups, but after reading [this excellent blog post](https://kyleshevlin.com/use-encapsulation?ck_subscriber_id=1352906140), my perspective changed.

The problem is that we are **creating a tiny spaghetti code** within our component body. The dependencies are somewhat hidden, leading to the increased cognitive effort required to understand what is going on within the code.

It would be much better to use **custom hooks declared in the same file**.

```jsx
function Component() {
  const [stateVariable1, setStateVariable1] = useState("foo");
  const [stateVariable2, setStateVariable2] = useState("bar");

  // mixing `setStateVariable1` and `setStateVariable2` in various handlers

  return <div>...</div>;
}

function useStateVariable1({ dependency1, dependency2 }) {
  return [...]
}

function useStateVariable2({ dependency1, dependency2 }) {
  return [...]
}
```

Even though I can't entirely agree with the author on how he writes the handlers (very liberate usage of `useCallback`), I second the idea of encapsulating the concerns fully.

Please note that **this technique only applies to situations where there are multiple concerns encapsulated in the logic of the body of the component**. This is not a silver bullet, and **should not be used "by default"**.

## Debouncing callbacks

> Note that in React 18, you have `useDeferredValue` at your disposal â€“ a much better way of debouncing a **synchronous** callback. Everything I write here still applies to the asynchronous callbacks.

### The need

You would like to apply a `debounce` on a callback. The callback can be passed to your component as a prop, or it could also be declared inline within the body of the component.

No matter the situation, there are a lot of cases you need to consider before considering your code correct. Let us look closer at the edge cases and how to deal with them.

### Single debounce instance

The most critical part of correctly debouncing your functions is to **ensure that you operate on a single instance of the debounced function throughout the component lifecycle**. If you do not, **you could introduce a latent bug in your application, where the timer powering debounce is reset when your component re-renders** (a situation similar to the issues one might encounter while implementing the `useInterval` hook).

In React, you have a couple of ways to ensure that you operate on a single instance of something â€“ by utilizing either `useRef`, `useCallback`, or `useMemo`. What follows is an example usage of applying debounce to a callback via the `useMemo` hook.

```jsx
import debounce from "lodash.debounce";
import { useMemo, useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  const onChange = useMemo(() => {
    return debounce((e) => setInputValue(e.target.value), 200);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {inputValue}
      <input type="text" onChange={onChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### The problem with `useRef`

As I eluded earlier, one **could** use `useRef` to ensure we operate on a single, mutable instance of a given value throughout the component lifecycle. However, the **`useRef` is NOT a good candidate for the debounce implementation**. The reason is that **with `useRef`, every time your component re-renders, the `debounce` function is invoked again and again**, which re-creates it, resetting the underlying timers in the process.

```jsx
import debounce from "lodash.debounce";
import { useRef, useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  const onChange = useRef(debounce((e) => setInputValue(e.target.value), 200));

  return (
    <div>
      {inputValue}
      <input type="text" onChange={onChange.current} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The implementation might seem harmless and make sense if you do not pay attention, but if you promote this code into production, **you have just introduced a potential latent bug into your system**.

Let me swap the `debounce` call within the `useRef` to a wrapper function that logs whenever the underlying `debounce` is called.

```jsx
import debounce from "lodash.debounce";
import { useRef, useState } from "react";

const myDebounce = (...props) => {
  console.log("Re-creating the debounce instance");
  return debounce(...props);
};

export default function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  const onChange = useRef(
    myDebounce((e) => setInputValue(e.target.value), 200)
  );

  return (
    <div>
      {inputValue}
      <input type="text" onChange={onChange.current} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Every time the `inputValue` changes, the `console.log` fires** indicating that we do not work with a single instance of the `debounce`d callback â€“ instead, we work with a single instance of the ref that contains a constantly changing instance of the `debounce`d callback!

### The problem with `useCallback`

Carrying out the same exercise we did before but swapping the `useRef` with `useCallback` shows very similar results.

```jsx
import debounce from "lodash.debounce";
import { useCallback, useState } from "react";

const myDebounce = (...props) => {
  console.log("Re-creating the debounce instance");
  return debounce(...props);
};

export default function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  const onChange = useCallback(
    myDebounce((e) => setInputValue(e.target.value), 200),
    []
  );

  return (
    <div>
      {inputValue}
      <input type="text" onChange={onChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Two problems here.

1. **Like in the case of `useRef`, we re-create the `debounce`d function every time the component re-renders**.
1. The linter complains -> `React Hook useCallback received a function whose dependencies are unknown. Pass an inline function instead.`

We can eliminate the linter warnings by changing the implementation to the following.

```jsx
const onChange = useCallback(
  (e) => myDebounce((e) => setInputValue(e.target.value), 200)(e),
  []
);
```

But, even with this modified form, we **still suffer from the initial problem of re-creating the `debounce`d function every time the component re-renders**.

### The solution with `useMemo`

The characteristics of the `useMemo` hook are a natural fit for what we are trying to accomplish. **Consider using `useMemo` when implementing a `debounce`d version of a given callback**.

```jsx
import debounce from "lodash.debounce";
import { useMemo, useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  const onChange = useMemo(() => {
    return debounce((e) => setInputValue(e.target.value), 200);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {inputValue}
      <input type="text" onChange={onChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

While the above solution works, it is not without its edge cases. In fact, you can shoot yourself in the foot pretty quickly here if you are not mindful of closures and the implications they might have.

#### The `useMemo` closure problem

```jsx
const onChange = useMemo(() => {
  return debounce((e) => setInputValue(e.target.value), 200);
}, []);
```

In the previous example, I **explicitly create a "wrapper" function around the `setInputValue` call** â€“ a deliberate effort to avoid problems with the stale `setInputValue` function. While the `setInputValue` function never changes, imagine a function that does change. If I were NOT to create the "function wrapper", the callback function passed to the `debounce` would have been stale after it changes.

An excellent example of a callback function that can change is a function our component receives from props. The following code snippet demonstrates this exact scenario.

```jsx
const callbackFromPropsRef = useRef(callbackFromProps);
useEffect(() => {
  callbackFromPropsRef.current = callbackFromProps;
}, [callbackFromProps]);

const onChange = useMemo(() => {
  return debounce(callbackFromPropsRef.current, 200);
}, []);
```

In this scenario, we create the `debounce`d function only once, but **the `debounce` callback will be stale (due to a closure) if the `callbackFromPropsRef.current` updates**. To make sure we always call the "latest" version of the `.current`, we must create a "wrapper function" around it, like so.

```jsx
const callbackFromPropsRef = useRef(callbackFromProps);
useEffect(() => {
  callbackFromPropsRef.current = callbackFromProps;
}, [callbackFromProps]);

const onChange = useMemo(() => {
  return debounce((value) => callbackFromPropsRef.current(value), 200);
}, []);
```
