# Joy of React

Going through [this course](https://www.joyofreact.com/) and writing what I've learned.

## React Fundamentals

- **React is platform agnostic**. That is why you have to import from `react` and, if you are writing a web app, `react-dom`.

  - There are different _renderers_ for different environments, like React Native or WebGL.

- There is a slight difference between _transpilation_ and _compilation_. While it does not really matter that much, since I'm curious, here it is:

  - The term _transpilation_ refers to going through a high-level language to another high-level language. You can _transpile_ JavaScript to Python.

  - The term _compilation_ refers to the process of transforming the code into a machine-readable code.

### Understanding JSX

- You might noticed that in some projects, there is only a single `import React from 'react'` in the entry file. All other files do not import React, even though they are using JSX. How come?

  - It used to be the case, that, if you used JSX, you had to explicitly import React. After all, the `JSX` are transformed to the `React.createElement` calls.

  - Since a lot of people did not know how JSX works, this "phantom" React import looked weird and caused issues when removed.

  - The React team decided to release a special _JSX transformer_ that would put the necessary imports for you when you use JSX. You no longer have to import React explicitly (of course, if you want to use hooks, you still have to import them from the `react` package).

- Have you ever wondered how `<div>{somethingHere}</div>` works? Mainly, how does the `{somethingHere}` is represented in JS and why we cannot use `if` statements there? **Josh names those _expression slots_**.

  - The `<div>{somethingHere}</div>` would be translated to the following

    ```js
    React.createElement(
      "div", // element
      {}, // props,
      null, // children
      somethingHere
    )
    ```

    Image putting an `if` statement in place of `somethingHere`. That would not work right? You **cannot pass `if` statements as parameters to a function**! Maybe you could wrap it with an IFFIe, and that works.

    ```js
    React.createElement(
      "div",
      {},
      null,
      (() => {
        if(true) {
          return "foo"
        }
      })()
    )
    ```

    So you **can write complex logic inside the JSX** but you have to wrap it with an IFFIe.

- Understanding how the _expression slots_ work, also explains the common issue with whitespace when writing JSX. Consider the following:

  ```jsx
  const element = (
    <div>
      <strong>Days until Santa returns:</strong>
      {daysUntilSantaReturns}
    </div>
  )
  ```

  This piece of JSX gets translated to the following:

  ```js
  React.createElement(
    "div",
    {},
    React.createElement(
      "strong",
      {},
      "Days until Santa returns:"
    ),
    daysUntilSantaReturns
  )
  ```

  Notice that there is no whitespace after `Santa returns:`. **This is causing the output to be "hugged together" without any spacing**.

- JSX and template-based languages like Handlebars are different things.

  - The template-based languages turn what you write into HTML at compile time.

  - The JSX will turn the syntax into JS. That JS is evaluated when the browser runs your application.

### Components

- Components must start with a capital letter. Like hook names, this is enforced by React.

  - This enables React to distinguish between built-in HTML tag, or a custom component.

- Of course, the JSX "invocations" of the components are also transpiled to `React.createElement` calls.

  ```jsx
  <div>
    <SomeComponent name = {"Wojciech"}/>
  </div>

  // is the same as
  React.createElement(
    'div',
    {}, // props
    React.createElement(
      SomeComponent,
      { name: "Wojciech" },
    ),
  )
  ```

- **While the prop name `children` is "reserved", it is not special in any kind from the `createElement` perspective**.

  - Ever wondered what will happen if you specify both the "component children" and the "html children" attributes? **It will be overwritten**.

    ```jsx
    <div children = "foo">some children</div>

    // outputs
    {
      "type": "div",
      "key": null,
      "ref": null,
      "props": {
        "children": "Hello World"
      },
      "_owner": null,
      "_store": {}
    }
    ```

    Notice that the `foo` is completely missing.

### Application structure

- Every React application usually shares a similar layout structure.

  - There is the `index.js` and the `App` component.

  - Do not put a lot of JSX into the `index.js`. It is meant to be a "setup" file.

### Fragments

Have you ever wondered why you cannot return multiple JSX nodes without wrapping them with some kind of element? **It boils down to how JavaScript (yes JavaScript) works**.

Consider the following function:

```js
function greet() {
  return (
    "Hi there"
    "Wojciech"
  )
}
```

This is not valid JavaScript. We cannot return multiple things from the function (that is possible in Go). Now, let change this scenario to JSX.

```jsx
return (
  <div>hi there</div>
  <div>Wojciech</div>
)
```

This is the same as if writing the following:

```jsx
return (
  React.createElement("div", {}, "hi there")
  React.createElement("div", {}, "Wojciech")
)
```

This does not work either. We cannot return multiple things from a function. **That is why you have to wrap multiple JSX nodes with a parent node**.
And if you want to do this **without introducing unnecessary HTML elements**, you should use the `React.Fragment` or `<>` (short version).

### Iteration

#### Mapping Over Data

- Using the `map`, and other functions which output arrays, to produce lists of JSX elements works because **React will "unpack" an array inside the _expression slot_ for us**.

  ```jsx
  return (
    <div>{["hi", "there"]}</div>
  )
  ```

  Imagine using `map` inside the _expression slot_ instead of hardcoding the data. This is how the syntax works. There is no magic.

  ```jsx
  <ul>
    {items.map(item => (
      <li>{item}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>

  // Transforms to
  React.createElement(
    "ul",
    {},
    items.map(item => (
      React.createElement(
        "li",
        {},
        item
      )
    ))
  )
  ```

#### Keys

- React needs the `key` prop to understand how the data changed between invocations of the component.

- You can imagine that the code to update a text (prop changed inside a component) is different than the code necessary to remove and add a new DOM node (marking todo as done and adding another one).

- In some cases, **when you are not deleting or shifting items, the `key` could be an `index`**. While this works, **why would you bother with an inferior method that can break when refactoring**. Instead **opt-in to something unique for a given item**. This is most likely an `id` but also could be a combination of item properties.

- Please note that the `key` is a "reserved keyword" in React. Even if it seems like you are passing it as a prop, the component will not have this prop defined.

  ```jsx
  <Button key = "123">foo</Button>

  const Button = ({key}) => {
    console.log(key) // undefined
  }
  ```

- You can **pass the `key` prop to a `React.Fragment`, but you have to use the "long" form, i.e the `Fragment` component**.

### Conditional Rendering

- While you cannot put JavaScript statements in the _expression slot_, we can pull those statements outside of JSX and use the result in JSX.

  ```jsx
  /*
    This will not work.
    Think about this in terms of the `React.createElement` calls.
  */
  <div>
    {if(foo) {
      return ""
    }}
  </div>

  let result = "baz";
  if (foo) {
    result = "bar";
  }

  /*
    This will work as you would expect.
    Again â€“ think in terms of the `React.createElement` calls.
  */
  <div>
    {result}
  </div>
  ```

- There is also the `&&` syntax which **is an expression rather than a statement**. As such we can use it inside the _expression slots_ directly.

  - Keep in mind the gotcha with `&&` and numbers.

    ```jsx
    // The following will render `0` in the JSX.
    const items = [];
    const numOfItems = items.length;

    <div>
      {numOfItems && <Button>bar</Button>}
    </div>
    ```

    The above will **render `0`. Why is that**? It is because **the `&&` does not return true of false, it returns either left or right side of the expression**. Check out the [mdn documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND).

  - As a rule of thumb: **always use a ternary operator instead of `&&`**.

    - Keep in mind that the **ternary operator will short-circuit branches depending on the initial condition**.

      ```js
      console.log("foo")
        ? console.log("bar")
        : console.log("other")
      ```

      In the above example, `bar` is never logged as this part of the code is never executed. **The `&&` operator works in a similar fashion**.

### Range Utility

- Very useful for creating arrays. Think when you have a "rating" and you need to create N stars to display the rating visually.

- There is no native function to do this.

- What works for me is the `Array.from({length: X}, mapFN)` syntax.

  - There is also the `Array(X).fill()`.

- Josh recommends creating a special utility function.

- **Keys do not have to be globally or "component" unique**. They **have to be unique within a given scope**. [See the React docs section about keys](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#rules-of-keys).

  ```jsx
  return (
    <div className="grid">
      {rows.map((rowIndex) => {
        return (
          // It's okay, the `rowIndex` is unique within this array.
          <div class="row" key={rowIndex}>
            {cols.map((colIndex) => {
          // It's okay, the `colIndex` is unique within this array.
              return <div className="cell" key={colIndex} />;
            })}
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
  ```

### Styling in React

- Josh recommends using CSS Modules at the beginning.

  - I completely agree. With the rise of RCSs, the CSS-in-JS libraries are a bit problematic, due to how they propagate the theme and all.

    - There are also other solutions that work similar to CSS-in-JS libraries but do not require a runtime component. Those seem to be the most widely adopted these days.

## Working With State

### Event Handlers

- Using the `onX` callbacks instead of attaching the listeners directly via `addEventListener` gives us a few benefits.

  - React is able to optimize the event handlers and can do batching (especially important for state updates).

  - React will automatically clean the event handlers. If we go the `addEventListener` route we have to do it ourselves.

### The `useState` hook

- Each time react "re-renders" the component, it will take that component output and compare with the previous output.

  - If the outputs differ, they React will commit changes to the DOM.

  - This means that **"re-rendering" does not mean updating the DOM**. It means comparing the outputs of the components.

  - The **process of comparing the "snapshots" is called _reconciliation_**.

- The state updates are async. This is to optimize performance. This allows **for batching of state updates to occur**.

### Forms

- The _controlled_ vs. _uncontrolled_ components.

- React dispatches so-called **_synthetic events_**.

  - These events are special objects created by React to ensure compatibility across different browsers.

  - You can still access the "native event" via the `.nativeEvent` property.

- When working with `select` tag, check out the `optgroup` which allows you to group options.

  - This pattern can be useful when also having a default "select a value" option.

    ```html
    <select>
      <option value = "">Select a value</option>
      <optgroup label = "Pets">
        <option value = "dog">Dog</option>
        <option value = "cat">cat</option>
      </optgroup>
    </select>
    ```

- **You might not need state for forms**. If you do not have to display the values from the inputs somewhere else, you could get away with only listening to `onSubmit` callback.

  ```jsx
    <form onSubmit = {event => {
      event.preventDefault();
      console.log(event.currentTarget.elements['name'].value) // the value of the name field.
    }}>
      <label htmlFor = "name">Name</label>
      <input type ="text" id = "name" name = "name"/>
    </form>
  ```

- **Consider NOT disabling the buttons**. There are [various problems with disabling buttons](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-disabled-buttons-and-what-to-do-instead/).

### Props vs. State

- Use props to "funnel" the state around the application.

### Complex state

- Never mutate the React state, even if it appears to be working.

  ```js
  colors[index] = "foo"; // mutation
  setColors([...colors])
  ```

  This might work, but it does not guarantee that this will always work. It is better to flip the operation order, like so.

  ```js
  const newColors = [...colors];
  newColors[index] = "foo";
  setColors(newCoors);
  ```

### Dynamic Key Generation

- In some cases, you will have to generate a random ID for the data you are iterating over.

- The **best solution would be to create some kind of random identifier when you are going to append a new item into the array** (assuming you start with an empty array).

  - There are various libraries that could help here, like `uuid` or `ulidx`.

  - There is also **native way to generate UUIDs, via the `crypto.randomUUID` function**.

- You could also generate the key **based on some unique properties of a given item**, though this might be slippery slope. While the data looks a certain way today, will it look the same way in the future?

### Component Instances

Have you ever wondered, how it is possible to use `useState` at all? Like the value resides?

Because if you think about it, when React invokes our component, it also invokes the `useState` with it's initializer. Would not that mean that each re-render we would "revert back" to the state value that was initially defined? Why is that not the case?

```jsx
function Component() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(0)

  return (
    <button onClick = {() => setState(prev => prev+1)}>click</button>
  )
}
```

Clicking the button will cause React to re-invoke the `Component`. As such, we should start with the `state` 0, but the `state` will be 1.

**The answer to this question lies to a concept called _component instance_**. It is the **_component instance_ that is a long-lived object managed by React that actually holds the state value**. React **will create the _component instance_ when the component is rendered for the first time**. It is the **rendering that creates the instances**.

If you **remove the component from the output, the _component instance_ is destroyed**. You can see this in action whenever you toggle some component that then holds the state. If you toggle it on-off-on the state is lost!

This concept is critical to understanding how the state works. I'm amazed that after spending so many years with React, I did not have this intuition.

## React Hooks

- Some hooks, like `useId` or `useState` are coupled to the _component instance_.

### `useId` Hook

- Generates unique id for every component instance.

- **The id is the same on the server (when SSRing) and on the client (during hydration)**.

  - This is a huge benefit of this hook. **This is not the case for 3rd party libraries like `uuid`**.

  - The **returned value is _stable_. It will not change**.

### Rules of Hooks

- React relies on the _order in which the hooks are called_. The order has to be the same between different invocations of the component.

  - This sounds bad to me. Relying on the order of the code may points to a bad internal design.

- In most cases, you will violate the rules by trying to render hooks conditionally.

  - You can refactor the code to pull the hooks closer to where they are used. Most likely to a separate component.

  - You can move the hooks before the condition. It is okay to use them even though they might be used in a component which is rendered conditionally.

### Refs

- Unlike state, one **should mutate the output of `useRef`**.

- You might be wondering why the `useRef` returns an object with a `current` property. **This is so that one could "escape" closures** or rather always have a fresh value within a given closure.

  - When passing the `ref` as a parameter, we pass the object as a reference. Any mutation of the `current` property will be reflected in the captured reference.

  - [You can read more about it here](https://github.com/WojciechMatuszewski/programming-notes/blob/master/web/react/react.md#why-does-useref-have-the-current-property).

- React will not re-render when the ref changes.

### Side Effects

- **Mind the _strict mode_**! In _strict mode_ the `useEffect` will fire twice.

  - Keep in mind that _strict mode_ is not re-creating components. It will re-run functions multiple times without changing the _component instance_.

    - This is why it is not really possible to simulate it. You would need access to React internals.

- **Before using `useEffect`** try to put the logic you would normally put there **into the event handler, if that is possible**.

  - Of course, **if there are multiple places where the state changes, you should consider `useEffect`**.

- Before using the `useEffect` + `ref` to focus the element, **consider using the `autofocus` attribute.

  - Sadly, **this attribute will not work for client-rendered apps** as the DOM node has to be there when the page first loads.

- When the `useEffect` runs, first it will **run previously queued cleanup functions**.

  - Of course, on the initial render there is no cleanup function.

- **Ask yourself is the thing you want to put into `useEffect` is really an effect**. Questioning your intuition most likely will result in better design.

### Custom Hooks

- Hooks should obey the same rules as normal functions would â€“ **hooks should be deep with a small interface**.

  - This means declaring as much state, variables and other related stuff inside the hook itself.

  - This makes the hook joy to use as the user of the hook does not have to worry about a lot of stuff.

- You can create a `toggle` hook via `useReducer`.

  ```jsx
  function useToggle(initialValue = false){
    return useReducer(
      (state) => !state,
      initialValue
    )
  }
  ```

### Data Fetching

- The `fetch` **will not throw when the response status code is different than 2xx**.

  - This make sense. From the `fetch` perspective, the request succeeded. The server responded with data.

  - The **`fetch` will only throw when there is some network communication issue between the client and the server**.

- Common gotcha is to try to use `async` functions inside the `useEffect`. No dice. You have to create an inner async function you then call.

  - Async functions are not compatible with `useEffect` API. The effect has to be synchronous, otherwise React would not be able to call the cleanup function in time (due to the promise still pending).


### Memoization

- **Re-rendering is NOT the same as re-painting**! Keep this in mind.

  - If the UI did not change, React will not commit to the DOM.

- **Every re-render is triggered by a state change**.

  - React will re-render **all children** of a component where state changed.

  - **Props have nothing to do with re-renders**. It is the state change, not the prop change that triggers re-renders.

- You can use the `React.memo` to signal to React that you want to skip re-renders of a given component when the props did not change.

  - This will stop the children of this component from re-rendering as well.

- We often over-estimate how expensive re-renders are. Again, committing to the DOM is usually much slower.

- The `useMemo`, while having a similar signature to `useEffect` runs at a very different time.

  - **`useMemo` runs synchronously during render**.

  - **`useEffect` runs synchronously AFTER rendering**.

- You can always implement `useCallback` with `useMemo`, but `useCallback` is much more convenient for functions.

  ```jsx
  const handleAddCount = useMemo(() => {
    return () => {
      setCount((current) => current + 10)
    }
  },[])

  const handleAddCount2 = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(current => current + 10)
  })
  ```

- **Before using memoization** consider using composition and moving components to `children`.

  - Remember: **if the "owner" of component state changes, all the children will re-render**. **You get to decide who is the owner**.

  ```jsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <ComponentThatReRendersOften>
          <ExpensiveChild/>
        </ComponentThatReRendersOften>
      )
    }
  ```

  In this case, the `ExpensiveChild` will **not re-render when `ComponentThatReRendersOften` re-renders**. This is because **the `App` component _owns_ the `ExpensiveChild`, not the `ComponentThatReRendersOften`**. This is crucial to understand. Using composition is a free optimization. It will also make your application more robust.

## Component API Design

- Just like backend APIs, React components also expose an API â€“ the props.

  - The "better" the API, the easier the component is to use.

  - The ideal component does what it needs to do and only that.

- Instead of passing the whole object as a prop, consider passing only the properties a given component would need.

  - This way, you are not forcing your fellow developers to see what props are used in a given component when refactoring.

    - Of course, if you are using TypeScript, while still valid, that advice is not that applicable anymore.

- When wrapping native HTML tags **consider forwarding all the native HTML props into the element you are rendering**.

  - I've seen many components that do not do this and it is always a pain to work with them. In such situation, you will most likely end up expanding the props of the component.

  - The **placing of the `{...deleted}` has a huge implications**. If you are not careful, customers of the component could override properties which you intended to have control over.

- Just like forwarding all the native HTML properties, **consider allowing the `className` as well**.

  - Very useful for CSS-in-JS libraries. `const styledButton = styled(Button)`.

  - Gives a bit more control to developers. While you might deem it a bad thing at first, consider that a lot of designs have "one-off" variations of a given component. If we do not accommodate for this, developers might create duplicate of the component. Not something we would want.

- The **`ref` is a reserved keyword in React**. Like the `key`, it **lives beside the `prop` property when using `React.createElement`**.

  ```jsx
    console.log(React.createElement(Button, {
      props: {
        // This property will be ignored.
        ref: ...
      }
    }))
  ```

  There are two solutions to passing the `ref` into the component.

    1. Use a different prop than `ref`. This approach works, but since all other native HTML tags take the `ref` prop, I do not think it is a good idea in most cases (in some cases, where typing the component props could be very challenging, I think it is acceptable).

      ```jsx
        const ref = useRef()
        <Button forwardedRef = {ref}/>
      ```

    2. Use the `forwardRef` function. This is usually what other developers do.


- When creating _polymorphic components_ (components that change their underlying tag), make sure to use upper-cased names for the tag.

  ```jsx
  function PolymorphicButton({href, ...delegated})  {
    const Tag = typeof href === "string" ? "a" : "button";
    return <Tag {...delegated}>
  }
  ```

  If I were to use `tag` instead of `Tag`, the **jsx compiler would interpret the `tag` as a HTML `tag` rather than a variable holding some value**.

- **Josh makes a case against _compound components_**. While I'm a big fan of this approach, his points resonate with me

  1. This pattern might be confusing to new developers.

  2. It prevents tree-shaking from working correctly.

    - I would say this is valid feedback, but does it really matter at such a granular level?

  3. **You might have issues in Next.js when using this pattern**.

    - Since this is very framework-specific, I'm unsure about the merit of this argument, but it is an argument nevertheless.

### Slots

- When using `children` prop, you are already leveraging the _slots_ pattern.

- The `children` prop is great, but we can only have a single `children` prop. What if we want to provide more "slot-like" props for the component?

  - In this case, **consider adding other, `children`-like components**. There is nothing wrong with having props take JSX.

    - In fact, it could be very good for performance-reasons as the slots are owned by the parent, but rendered within the child. If the child changes, the slots will not re-render!

- _Slots_ **are not a silver bullet**. Imagine the following scenario.

  ```jsx
    <IconButton icon = {<Star size = {999}/>}>Some Text</IconButton>
  ```

  We certainly do not want the consumer to be able to specify a huge icon like that. **We want the customer to have a flexibility of providing the markup, but we want the `IconButton` to control the props**.

  How do we solve the problem?

    1. Use the `cloneElement` API and override the props.

    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <IconButton icon = {<Star size = {999}>}/>
      )
    }

    function IconButton({icon}) {
      const iconModified = React.cloneElement(icon, {
        // override the props here
        size: 20
      })
    }
    ```

    2. Pass the `icon` as a reference. Do no render it in the parent.

    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <IconButton Icon = {Size}/>
      )
    }

    function IconButton({Icon}) {
      return <button>{<Icon size = {20}/>}</button>
    }
    ```

  Both approaches are valid.

### Context

- The `Context` API is mainly there to prevent _prop drilling_.

  - Keep in mind that **the API is not for state management, but rather for distributing data that does not change often**.

- Having multiple _context providers_ is a good idea.

  - It makes the app more performant, as the more granular the context, the more granular data access could be. You would not want a component which depends on `user` to change when some other piece of data in the context changes.

  - In addition, it makes the code more modular. This is quite important, especially when it comes to testing.

- Keep in mind **that the `Context` API is like a hidden prop. If your component uses `React.memo`, context change will ALWAYS trigger a re-render**.

  - Since the prop is "implicit" or "hidden", you cannot compare its previous value with the current value and skip re-rendering.

  - Either way, **if the place you render the provider in can change, you should memoize the context value**.

    ```jsx
      function Provider({children}) {
        const [state, setState] = useState({
          // some values
        })

        const value = useMemo(() => {
          return {state, setValue}
        }, [state])
        return <Context.Provider value = {value}>{children}</Context.Provider>
      }
    ```

    If we did not use `useMemo` in the example above, the `value` object would change every time the `Provider` re-renders (for example when the parent updates). This would trigger a re-render of every consumer of the context, as the `value` would be a new object!


  - **Memoizing the _Provider_ component might be a mistake â€“ the `children` will ALMOST always be different if the parent changes**!

    - The `children` is an object (result of calling the `React.createElement`). As such, it will **almost always** have a different reference when the parent changes.

    - I wrote _almost always_ since there is a "trick" you can utilize to make the component constants.

      ```jsx
      const constantChild = <Child/>

      function App() {
        return (
          <MemoizedComponent>
            {constantChild}
          </MemoizedComponent>
        )
      }
      ```

      As an alternative, you can `useMemo` a given component.


      ```jsx
      function App() {
        const child = useMemo = (() => {
          return <Child prop = {value}>
        }, [value]);

        return (
          <MemoizedComponent>
            {child}
          </MemoizedComponent>
        )
      }
      ```

      **This only works if the `Child` does not take any props, or the props are "static" (not derived from state)**.

## Happy Practices

### Leveraging Keys

- Consider using **the `key` prop to "reset" a given component**.

  - React will re-create a component when the `key` changes.

  - Whenever you do this, remember that **what you are really telling React is that the element is different, as such React will re-create a given component**.

  - Sometimes you will have to derive the key from state. That is totally fine, especially if you want the component to be re-created only when a given portion of the state changes.

### Elements Revisited

- **React keeps track of which state belongs to which component based on their place in the UI tree**. To illustrate, consider the following.

  ```tsx
    function Component() {
      const [color, setColor] = useState(undefined)

      return (
        <div>
        {color ? <Button color = {color}/> : <Button/>}
        // color picker
        </div>
      )
    }

    function Button({color}) {
      const [state, setState] = useState(0)

      return (<button style = {{color}} onClick = {() => setState(prev => prev+1)}>click</button>)
    }
  ```

  What suppose happens if you increment the state inside the `Button` and then change the color? Would the button state be reset? **That is not the case because the `Button` is still the same component in the tree**. The `key` of that component did not change, as such React will preserve the component instance.

  This is also the reason why the following buttons do not share the state ([example from official React docs](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state)).

  ```jsx
    export default function App() {
      const counter = <Counter />;

      return (
        <div>
          {counter}
          {counter}
        </div>
      );
    }
  ```

  **You might think that the `Counter` shares the state here â€“ THAT is not the case**! Both counters are rendered in different parts of the tree. Also **keep in mind that `React.createElement` gets a reference to the component function**.

  Always remember that the **component instance is tied to the place in the tree**. Even if you have conditionals and so on, **if the position in the tree is the same between re-renders, the state is preserved**.

### Deriving State

- If something can be derived from state, it probably should be derived from state.

- **As apps more grow in complexity, the state will also grow in complexity**. If you derive from the state as much as possible, you inherently make the state less complex.

- **Deriving from state will also make your app simpler**. Sometimes we try to _sync_ the state with another state via `useEffect`. This is usually not a good idea. It makes the app more complex, and you will most likely make a mistake.

  - Syncing the state with another state causes _at least_ two re-render cycles. First, caused by the original state update, second by syncing the state.

- Of course, **this is not a silver bullet**. By deriving from the state, we are coupling the state with another part of the application that uses the derived state.

  - Usually this is not a problem, and event if it becomes one, it is **much easier to refactor derived state into its own state, than to have the state be separate in the first place**.

### Lifting Content Up

- _Lifting Content Up_ is to structure your application in a way that leverages composition. Either through `children` or _slots_ props.

- Apart from **parent and child relationship** there is also the **concept of owners and ownees**.

  ```jsx
  function App() {
    <SomeComponent>
      <OtherComponent/>
    </SomeComponent>
  }
  ```

  In the example above, **it is the `App` that owns both the `SomeComponent` and `OtherComponent`**. It can decide what that component props are. **The `SomeComponent` is a parent of `OtherComponent`**.

- This technique is not to be applied everywhere (but in most cases it is beneficial). Be pragmatic. Sometimes it is not worth complicating the API.

### Single Source of Truth

- Components should either be _controlled_ or _uncontrolled_. **You should never have a mix of two**.


  Consider the following example. In the example below, we are mixing the _controlled_ and _uncontrolled_ paradigms. **This makes the code hard to read and very prone to bugs**.

  ```jsx
    function App() {
      const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

      return (
        <div>
          <Counter value ={counter} onChange={setCounter}/>
          <Reset onReset = {() => setCounter(0)}/>
        </div>
      )
    }

    function Counter({value, onChange}) {
      const [internalValue, setInternalValue] = useState(value);

      useEffect(() => {
        setInternalValue(value)
      }, [value])

      return <button onClick = {() => {
        const newValue = internalValue + 1;
        setInternalValue(newValue);
        onChange(newValue);
      }}>{internalValue}</button>
    }
  ```

  The solution would be to **make the `Counter` to be controlled â€“ get rid of the internal state**! As an alternative, one **might use the `key` prop to reset the `Counter` state**. This is a valid solution as well.

- Keep in mind that **it is okay to copy props into state when the props are "initial props"**.


### Portals

- When creating portals, remember that you can inject inside the `document.body` directly.

  ```jsx
    return createPortal(
      <div data-react-portal-host>
        {children}
      </div>,
      document.body
    )
  ```

  Look how easy it is! No need for `useEffects` and tracking of DOM elements!
