  <h2>About Iceland</h2>

  <p>
    Iceland (Icelandic: √çsland; [ÀàiÀês(t)lant]) is a Nordic island country in the
    North Atlantic Ocean, with a population of 356,991 and an area of 103,000
    km2 (40,000 sq mi), making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe.
    The capital and largest city is Reykjav√≠k. Reykjav√≠k and the surrounding
    areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the
    population.

  <h3>Etymology</h3>
  <p>
    The Sagas of Icelanders say that a Norwegian named Naddodd (or Naddador) was
    the first Norseman to reach Iceland, and in the 9th century he named it
    Sn√¶land or "snow land" because it was snowing. Following Naddodd, the Swede
    Gar√∞ar Svavarsson arrived, and so the island was then called Gar√∞arsh√≥lmur
    which means "Gar√∞ar's Isle".

    <h3>Geography, Geology, and Climate Geography</h3>

    <h4>Geography</h4>
    <p>
      Iceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The
      main island is entirely south of the Arctic Circle, which passes through
      the small Icelandic island of Gr√≠msey off the main island's northern
      coast. The country lies between latitudes 63 and 68¬∞N, and longitudes 25
      and 13¬∞W.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iceland is closer to continental Europe than to mainland North America,
      although it is closest to Greenland (290 km, 180 mi), an island of North
      America. Iceland is generally included in Europe for geographical,
      historical, political, cultural, linguistic and practical reasons.
      Geologically, the island includes parts of both continental plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iceland is the world's 18th-largest island, and Europe's second-largest
      island after Great Britain. (The island of Ireland is third.) The main
      island covers 101,826 km2 (39,315 sq mi), but the entire country is
      103,000 km2 (40,000 sq mi) in size, of which 62.7% is tundra.

    </p>

    <p>
      A geologically young land, Iceland is the surface expression of the
      Iceland Plateau, a large igneous province forming as a result of volcanism
      from the Iceland hotspot and along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the latter of
      which runs right through it. This means that the island is highly
      geologically active with many volcanoes including Hekla, Eldgj√°,
      Her√∞ubrei√∞, and Eldfell.
    </p>

    <h4>Climate</h4>
    <p>
      The climate of Iceland's coast is subarctic. The warm North Atlantic
      Current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places
      of similar latitude in the world. Despite its proximity to the Arctic, the
      island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter.
