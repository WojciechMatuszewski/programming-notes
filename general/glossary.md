## Load shedding

Act of dropping work to preserve the system availability. It's much better, in the scenario of overload, to prioritize some of the requests and process those and drop others than to try to fullfil every request. [More on this topic here](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/using-load-shedding-to-avoid-overload/)

## Heuristics

In software, it refers to the "way of doing things". Usually, derived from experience and learning based techniques.

## Lock-step deployment

Where you have two or more services which need to be deployed together. This indicates tight coupling and might lead to problems and deadlocks later on. An excellent example of a _lock-step deployment_ problem is **an API backed by AWS Lambda FURL and the frontend** â€“ the Lambda FURL URL tightly coupled to the function name. If that changes, the URL changes (the solution might be a DNS record).

## Back pressure

Back pressure is when you cannot process data that is coming to you fast enough.
Let's say you are working on a search bar input. You would not want to send http
request every keystroke right?. That's back pressure, there is no way for you to
process keystroke information fast enough. What do you do? You probably debounce
or throttle it.

Back pressure usually stems from the fact that you do not have the ability to
control the producer (and are working in a _push_ environment).

Other solutions may include

- buffering
- sampling (giving only a sample of processed data)

## Memoization

Pretty standard technique to prevent unnecessary computation. You create a cache
and store previously computed results there. One catch is that you have to be
careful with cache size. It might grow pretty fast and then you do you do.

**You should probably only use memoization with pure functions**.

Simple example

```js
function memoize(func) {
  return function memoized() {
    // we are doing it old school :D
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    // cache can be a closed over variable or variable on function itself
    func.cache = func.cache || {};

    var cachedResult = func.cache[args];

    if (cachedResult != null) return cachedResult;

    var computationResult = func.apply(this, args);

    func.cache[args] = computationResult;
    return computationResult;
  };
}
```
