# Epic Programming Principles

Taking notes while [reading this series of posts](https://www.epicweb.dev/principles).

## ## Core Philosophy

- You are always building _for the people_.

  - Customers come in various forms. They could be a team that you cooperate with, or "regular customers" we usually think of.

    - Regardless, **make sure it is built well and FOR those people**. This **includes people with disabilities**.

- Facilitate in-person connections.

  - Think of the people you like to work with. What are they doing that you feel this way? **Replicate it**, but **always be yourself**.

- Positive gestures come a long way.

- Being kind works!

- Default to assuming a good intent.

- **Value your time**.

  - It is **okay to NOT build something, so you can build something else**.

    - Drop your ego. You do not have all the answers.

- Best problems are those that do not exist or solve themselves.

  - Before starting working on anything, **ask yourself if you REALLY need to solve this problem. If you do, is what you are about to do, the most sustainable way to do it?**

## Craft

- The **so-called "best practices" change with time**.

  - Do not be a hostage of "best practices". **Notice is what is constant and do that, all of the rest will change**.

- **Build what you need, and only that**.

  - You can lay foundations for the future, but do not go further than that â€“ you can't predict the future.

- **Being pragmatic often means cutting corners but in a way that minimizes code debt**.

  - Example: pre-made components that might not look and feel great in your app could unblock a very important use-case for your customers.

- **Do not dismiss things simply because they are unfamiliar, and in turn, look "complex" or "hard"**.

  - Tools that we are unfamiliar with might look scary at first, but, if the tool is well designed, it will increase your velocity, not drag it down.

  - **Simple != familiar**.

- **Take ownership for each dependency**.

  - Dependencies are often times sources of failure. You should evaluate what you depend on carefully.
